## Objective
The purpose of this post is to gain expert input on how various metrics may be weighted when valuing the outcomes of a montitoring design with respect to the fundamental objectives.  In order to do so we ask that you fill out a swing weighting form (linked in step 1 below). The PSPAP 2.0 team will not be making decisions based on this information.  Instead, we will compile the collected data and report it to the decision makers. We'll inform the decision makers about how different agencies and stakeholders value the fundamental objectives and how these values relate to the outcomes of various monitoring designs.     

In order to understand swing weighting and how it applies to some of the particular objectives and metrics, we are also including links to a tutorial and examples. Thank you all for your participation! 


## Process
1. Be sure you can open and edit the swing weighting exercise (it's an excel file with 5 sheets): [Download Exercise](swing-weighting-exercise-draft.xlsx) 
1. For those looking for a more in depth understanding of how and why we are using swing weighting in PSPAP 2.0, please watch the  "Swing Weighting Tutorial":   [Swing Weighting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2nVRkpmWQY).  
*For those wanting to move right into the swing weighting exercise, jump to step 3.*
2. Listen, watch, and understand the abundance and trend metric explantions and examples:  [Abundance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKX0Uw7Ta0A)   and   [Trend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPbdE_dK1vk)
3. Fill in all empty boxes (on all 5 sheets) of the swing weighting form, using the ideas from the links above. Instructions are also included at the bottom of each excel sheet. 
4. Email the filled in form to: s.reynolds@msstate.edu.
