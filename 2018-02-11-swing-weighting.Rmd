## Objective

The purpose of this post is to elicit input on how various metrics may 
be weighted when valuing the outcomes of a montitoring design with 
respect to the fundamental objectives. In order to do so, we ask that 
you fill out a swing weighting form (excel workbook linked in step 1 
below). The PSPAP 2.0 team will not be making decisions based on this 
information. Instead, the information will be summarized and used to 
calculate the expected utility (i.e., what is the value of alternative 
monitoring designs to achieve objectives) for decision maker evaluation. 
We'll inform the decision makers about how different agencies and 
stakeholders value the fundamental objectives and how these values 
relate to the value of various monitoring designs. 



In order to understand swing weighting and how it applies to some of the 
particular objectives and metrics, we are also including links to a 
tutorial and examples. Thank you all for your participation!

It may take 10 to 20 minutes to work through this exercise. 
 
For those looking for a more in depth understanding of how and why we 
are using swing weighting in PSPAP 2.0, please watch the "Swing 
Weighting Tutorial (11 minutes)": [Swing 
Weighting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2nVRkpmWQY). 


## Process
1. Be sure you can open and edit the swing weighting exercise (it's an excel file with 5 sheets): [Download Exercise here](swing-weighting-exercise-draft.xlsx) 
2. Fill in all empty boxes (on all 5 sheets) of the swing weighting form. 
    1. Instructions to fill out each worksheet are included at the bottom of each excel sheet.
    2. See 2 example demonstrations (YouTube videos) filling in the [Abundance (5 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKX0Uw7Ta0A) and [Trend (4 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPbdE_dK1vk) worksheets. 3. Email the filled in form to: s.reynolds@msstate.edu.
