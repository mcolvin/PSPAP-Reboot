## Objective
The purpose of this post is to gain expert input on how various metrics may be weighted when valuing the outcomes of a montitoring design with respect to the fundamental objectives. In order to do so we ask that you fill out a swing weighting form (linked in step 1 below). In order to understand swing weighting and how it applies to some of our particular objectives and metrics, we are also including links to a tutorial and examples. Thank you all for your participation! 


## Process
1. Be sure you can open and edit the swing weighting exercise (it's an excel file with 5 sheets): <a href='swing-weighting-exercise-draft.xls' target="_blank">Download Exercise</a> 
1.  Listen and watch the "Swing Weighting Tutorial":   [Swing Weighting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57XeTdCEH7E)
2. Listen, watch, and understand the abundance and trend metric explantions and examples:  [Abundance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKX0Uw7Ta0A)   and   [Trend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPbdE_dK1vk)
3. Fill in all empty boxes (on all 5 sheets) of the swing weighting form, using the ideas from the links above. Instructions are also included at the bottom of each excel sheet. 
4. Email the filled in form to: s.reynolds@msstate.edu.
