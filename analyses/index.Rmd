Current assessment and AM
The objectives are:

Fundamental Objective: Avoid jeopardizing the continued existence of the pallid sturgeon from the US
Army Corps of Engineers actions on the Missouri River.

Sub-objective 1: Increase pallid sturgeon recruitment to age 1.

1. Metrics: primary metric is catch rates of age 0 and age 1 pallid sturgeon;
2. secondary metrics include model-based estimates of abundance of age 0 and age 1 pallid sturgeon, and the survival of hatchery and naturally reproducing fish to age 1.

Sub-objective 2: Maintain or increase numbers of pallid sturgeon as an interim measure until sufficient and sustained natural recruitment occurs.

Study objectives
Pallid Sturgeon only...

The objectives of this study are to:

* provide potential approaches that will meet population objective
* feed into ongoing adaptive management
* build on or cross wal
