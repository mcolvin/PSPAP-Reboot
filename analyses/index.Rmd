The objectives are:

Fundamental Objective: Avoid jeopardizing the continued existence of the pallid sturgeon from the US
Army Corps of Engineers actions on the Missouri River.

Sub-objective 1: Increase pallid sturgeon recruitment to age 1.

1. Metrics: primary metric is catch rates of age 0 and age 1 pallid sturgeon;
2. secondary metrics include model-based estimates of abundance of age 0 and age 1 pallid sturgeon, and the survival of hatchery and naturally reproducing fish to age 1.

Sub-objective 2: Maintain or increase numbers of pallid sturgeon as an interim measure until sufficient and sustained natural recruitment occurs.

Study objectives
Pallid Sturgeon only...

The objectives of this study are to:

* provide potential approaches that will meet population objective
* feed into ongoing adaptive management
* build on or cross walk


## Marked populations




Abundance

Site-level

* How many replicates are needed to estimate abundance reliably?  What is reliable?
    * Constant p
    * Heterogeneous capture probability
    * Some movement in and out
* Benefit of using tagged critters?

Segment-level

* Estimates from 25% of bends in segment per year?
* Dependent on bend size
* Relate to density?
* Consequences of some movement?

Survival

* Robust design
    * M0- varies by bend $\text{logit}(p)={{\beta }_{0}}+{{\beta }_{1}}\cdot Bend$
    * Mt â€“ varies by bend and secondary occasion $\text{logit}(p)={{\beta }_{0}}+{{\beta }_{1}}\cdot Bend+{{\beta }_{2}}\cdot Occasion+{{\beta }_{3}}\cdot Bend\cdot Occasion$ 
    * Constant phi within segment, varies among years
        * $\operatorname{logit}(\phi )={{\beta }_{0}}+{{\epsilon }_{year}}$ where ${{\epsilon }_{year}}\tilde{\ }N(0,\sigma )$ 
* Robust design with telemetry 
    * In segment (perfect detection, imperfect detection)
    * River sweep (perfect detection, imperfect detection)
        * $\operatorname{logit}(\phi )={{\beta }_{0}}+{{\epsilon }_{year}}$ where ${{\epsilon }_{year}}\tilde{\ }N(0,\sigma )$ 
        * ${{Z}_{track,segement,year}}\tilde{\ }binomial({{\phi }_{segment,year}})$ 
        * River sweep to inform $\phi$, $\gamma \prime $, and $\gamma\prime\prime$from tracking tags

        
1. Do fish move large distances outside of migrations?  What is the optimal time to do capture-recapture? Options: none, some, a lot.  
2. What is better to estimate as a random subset of bends or randomly tag a bunch of fish and recapture in random bends?
