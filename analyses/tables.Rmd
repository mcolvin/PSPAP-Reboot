S=Denotes the Standard (required) gear type for a given habitat
E=Denotes a gear that is undergoing an experimental evaluation proposal.
All other Applications are wild (W)
Applicable to all gear types and habitats: Deploy gear within a habitat type where conditions (depth, width, velocity) allow proper deployment
* Island Tips are only associated with Secondary Connected, Deranged, Braided and Dendritic Channels
**Excludes non-flowing pools
