Welcome the the PSPAP-V2 blog. The Effects Analysis team is exploring a 
blog as an approach for effective communication with stakeholders about 
the evaluation of varying Missouri River Pallid Sturgeon monitoring 
designs and integration with the Missouri River adaptive management 
plan. 


A blog format was selected for used because of the archival nature of 
communications but also the ability for stakeholders to provide feedback 
in the comments section. A comments section will be available for each 
post. Readers can comment using existing credentials (e.g., Google, 
Facebook). Commenters may also leave comments as guests, however these 
comments will go through moderator approval before they are posted.
