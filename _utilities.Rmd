# Fundamental objectives

## Quantify PS recruitment to age 1.
 
## Provide estimates with associated uncertainty needed to run the PS population model

## Quantify PS population trend

## Maintain compatibility with legacy data


## Cost

Cost is the ultimate PSPAP constraint. Designs exceeding cost 
containments will not be considered. Significant uncertainty exists in 
costs because of several factors. First, field crews tend to become more 
efficient over time and therefore recent PSPAP costs may not represent 
the actual costs. However, if the next iteration of the PSPAP uses similar 
sampling units (i.e., bends within segments) to the current PSPAP, 
then costs for field sampling will likely be similar. 


### Estimating cost to sample a bend

Estimating cost for a day of sampling is difficult. It is the function 
of several factors, including but not limited to the number of 
personnel, pay rates, other personnel expenses, travel, time sampling, 
and gear maintenance. Additionally, the cost of sampling varies among years
and costs may be non linearly related if there is economy of scale (i.e.,
it may cost less per sampling unit if many are done). 

1. Annual funding provided to each field crew
1. Calculate the number of bends sampled in a year
1. Divide the cost by the total to get a field crew specific
cost per bend. 
1. Model or empirical distribution


* The season will begin when water temperatures decline to 55Â°F or less 
(in the fall) and will continue through June 30. 
* The Fish Community Season will be July 1 through October 30 throughout 
the geographic range of the PSPAP. 

### Important assumptions

Currently the analysis assumes that the period
of performance for field crews is the same as 
the fiscal year.
