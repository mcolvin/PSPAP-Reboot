<h1>Evaluation context for the PSPAP V. 2.0</h1>
<p>Redesign of the Pallid Sturgeon Population Assessment Program (PSPAP) to PSPAP v. 2.0 is intended to update population assessment to support adaptive management of the Missouri River Recovery Program (MRRP). PSPAP v. 2.0 is considered to be a necessary part of the pallid sturgeon monitoring strategy, but it is not considered to be sufficient for monitoring needs. Instead, it is designed to be complementary to three other components: effectiveness monitoring, focused research studies, and the collaborative population model. These four components define the information framework needed to understand and predict population responses to management action (fig. 1).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Pallid Sturgeon Population Assessment Program v. 2.0. The fundamental objective of PSPAP v. 2.0 is to provide essential population-level information needed for the MRRP to make decisions about its fundamental objectives, including, but not limited to:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Discern status and trends of the pallid sturgeon population; serve as validation of model predictions.</li>
<li>Complement and enhance understanding of linkages from management actions to population responses. PSPAP v. 2.0 cannot provide direct linkages to all management actions but will be especially important in evaluating population responses to augmentation and stocking decisions.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Effectiveness monitoring. Each MRRP action has an associated monitoring plan that is designed to provide insights into whether the action has the intended ecological effect. These are presently being defined for flow cues, passage around Intake Dam, spawning habitat, interception-rearing complexes (IRCs), and rehabilitation of shallow-water habitat projects. These effectiveness monitoring plans focus on the implementation monitoring (i.e., was the management action implemented as intended?) and process-based monitoring (i.e., did the management action achieve desired changes to ecological processes thought to lead to increased growth and survival?). They do not address population-level responses to the actions directly. Instead, they provide information complementary to PSPAP v2.0, the Collaborative Population Model, and focused research studies, which will be needed to link the management actions to the population-level effect. An overview of the effectiveness monitoring approach for each of the MRRP actions, with IRCs presented as a more detailed example, is provided in a companion white paper.</li>
<li>Focused research studies. The level 1 and level 2 focused research studies described in appendix C of the Missouri River Science and Adaptive Management Plan (MRSAMP) are designed to provide fundamental understanding of pallid sturgeon ecology in the Missouri River and to develop quantitative response models. For example, level 1 mesocosm studies on foraging bioenergetics of age-0 sturgeon are meant to translate changes in habitat characteristics in IRCs (depths, velocities, and bottom conditions) into changes in growth and survival. Other level 1 studies are intended to develop technologies that can be used to measure responses, such as improvements in telemetry systems and direct measurements of habitat conditions and egg survival.</li>
<li>Collaborative Population Model. The Collaborative Population Model documented in Jacobson and others (2016) serves as the framework to integrate understanding from effectiveness monitoring, focused research, and PSPAP v. 2.0. Changes in model parameters values associated with actions (for example, increases in age-0 survival associated with IRCs or increases in viable gametes associated with flow cues or spawning habitats) will be incorporated into the model to provide predictive understanding (and uncertainties) of population-level responses associated with management action. PSPAP v. 2.0 may provide additional parameter estimates (for example gender ratios, fecundity, age at first reproduction, and recrudescent intervals). Importantly, PSPAP v. 2.0 will provide the empirical data on population status and trends needed to validate population model results.</li>
</ol>
<p>The remainder of this paper focuses on the design process elements for PSPAP v. 2.0. It should be noted that this redesign process and possible changes affect many stakeholders. Stakeholders include state and federal agencies, agencies contracted to collect data, consulting groups working on the adaptive management plan, and the USACE which provides the resources to conduct the assessment. Therefore we are using a structured decision making process to provide a transparent and rigorous approach to evaluate alternative monitoring designs in the context of stakeholder objectives and accounting for uncertainty (Conroy and Peterson 2013). This process began in March 2017 and is expected to extend through early spring 2019, according to this schedule:</p>
<ul>
<li>March 21, 2017: Workshop developing objective hierarchy and elicit logistical sampling information from stakeholders</li>
<li>Spring 2017  Fall 2017: Model sampling scenarios  explore approaches to meeting objectives, mix of methods, benefit:cost of objectives. Communicate progress through PSPAP v. 2.0 blog.</li>

</ul>

<div id="background-of-pspap-v.-2.0-design" class="section level1">
<h1>Background of PSPAP v. 2.0 Design</h1>
<p>The need to redesign the PSPAP was triggered by the recognition that the current PSPAP may not allow evaluation of whether pallid sturgeon fundamental objectives identified in the AM plan were achieved on an annual basis or estimated with any level of certainty. Specifically, sub-objectives listed in section 4.1.1. of the AM plan specify 1) increase pallid sturgeon recruitment to age-1, and 2) maintain or increase numbers of pallid sturgeon as an interim measure until sufficient and sustained natural recruitment occurs, both of which are needed to achieve the fundamental objective set by the USFWS to preclude species jeopardy. These two sub-objectives are redefined as fundamental objectives in the context of the monitoring program to quantify recruitment to age-1 and quantify pallid sturgeon population trend and abundance.</p>
<p>The first sub-objective (increase pallid sturgeon recruitment to age-1) is based on the understanding that bottlenecks for pallid sturgeon populations are likely in age-0 survival and that after the first year of life, survival increases substantially (DeLonay et al. 2016). Metrics to assess achievement of this objective are particularly challenging because of the rarity of the species and existing technical difficulties with capturing age-1 (and age-2, age-3) fish and in accurately determining ages. As direct assessment of recruitment to age-1 is unlikely to be successful, the PSPAP v. 2.0 process has proceeded with the assumption that recruitment will need to be assessed through estimates of abundance and trend of older fish, determination of hatchery or wild origin, and back-calculation of age-1 recruitment rates through a well-calibrated and validated population model. Success of the second sub-objective (maintain or increase numbers of pallid sturgeon as an interim measure) can be assessed through direct empirical abundance and trend data, but the assessment can be enhanced, and better linked to management actions, through incorporation of monitoring data into the collaborative population model.</p>
</div>
<div id="redesign-objectives" class="section level1">
<h1>Redesign objectives</h1>
<p>The objective of the redesign effort is to identify sampling designs and abundance and trend estimators that will give optimal estimates given budget constraints. Our approach is to compare metrics of estimator success and associated sampling costs across multiple estimators and sampling strategies, while accounting for uncertainties about whether monitoring program objectives were achieved.</p>
<p>The following sections outline the approach used for this comparison. The methods described below are overviews intended to provide sufficient understanding of the process but not overwhelm the document with technical details. It should also be noted that evaluating alternative monitoring designs is not trivial, and at times requires days of computing time to run estimators and various simulations with sufficient numbers of replications to fully characterize the potential outcomes.</p>
</div>
<div id="pspap-stakeholders-and-eliciting-monitoring-objectives" class="section level1">
<h1>PSPAP stakeholders and eliciting monitoring objectives</h1>
<p>Many state and federal agencies contracted to collect pallid sturgeon population assessment data will be affected by changes to the current PSPAP design, as well as consulting groups and management agencies dependent on monitoring data to inform adaptive management. We convened a face-to-face stakeholder workshop during the MRNRC meeting in March 2017 to present an overview of the redesign process and to elicit stakeholder<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> objectives for the program. Five fundamental information objectives of the PSPAP were identified at the workshop: 1) quantify recruitment to age-1, 2) quantify population trend and abundance, 3) provide collaborative population model inputs (improved parameter estimates), 4) maintain compatibility with legacy PSPAP data, and 5) remain within cost constraints. Stakeholders identified many means objectives that potentially contribute to the fundamental objectives; they also provided critical information on logistics of sampling. Means objectives included varying population metrics to monitor and approaches needed to quantify the metrics. Metrics identified during the objectives elicitation were organized to 8 categories. Specifically, stakeholders identified metrics relating to population structure (e.g., age and size structure, sex ratio), reproductive status (e.g., fecundity, reproductive cycling, size at sexual maturity), health status (e.g., stress, condition, diet, contaminants), population augmentation, movement (i.e., spawning, seasonal), demographic rates (e.g., recruitment, survival), fish community (e.g., competition, invasive species), and genetic status (e.g., effective population size, hybridization, local adaptation). Stakeholder objectives were organized in an influence diagram during the workshop. The influence diagram serves 2 purposes. First, it clarifies stakeholders’ fundamental and means objectives, thereby increasing transparency. Second, the influence diagram can be developed into a Bayesian Decision Network (BDN) to evaluate alternative PSPAP designs (Marcot et al. 2001, Nyberg et al. 2006, Conroy and Peterson 2013). The development and parameterization of the BDN required 2 steps: 1) translate nodes in the influence diagram to quantifiable metrics that can be estimated from a monitoring program and 2) stochastically simulate the range of possible outcomes for a node, conditional on influencing nodes. This work is continuing and the methods below provide a limited overview of the process.</p>
<div id="translate-nodes-in-influence-diagram-to-quantifiable-metrics" class="section level2">
<h2>1) Translate nodes in influence diagram to quantifiable metrics</h2>
<p>The influence diagram was modified to develop a BDN. Specifically, nodes in the influence diagram were classified as nature, decision, or utility nodes. Nature nodes represent quantifiable metrics and the range of possible outcomes quantified as probabilities. For example, it is uncertain what level of recruitment might occur in the system, which in turn may influence the optimal monitoring design. Therefore recruitment uncertainty can be included by including a range of plausible recruitment levels and frequencies. Additionally, other important variables were added to the BDN  although not identified during the objectives elicitation  if they were considered to influence whether or not the objectives could be achieved. For example, catch depends on gear-specific catchability which is uncertain but can be bounded to reasonable levels from estimates of capture probability.</p>
<p>The fundamental objectives were developed as utility functions that value the outcome of a monitoring design. For example, the fundamental objective to quantify population abundance and trend was quantified by calculating the bias, precision, and performance of alternative PSPAP designs. The bias of an estimator used with a particular sampling design is computed as the expected value of the difference between the estimated value and the actual value, where the expectation is taken over all estimates made by the given estimator on all catch data simulated under the given sampling design. Actual values can be treated as knowns since they are reported in or can be derived from a simulated reference population (described below). Precision is calculated as the expected ratio of the standard error to the absolute value of the estimate (more precise estimators have lower values of precision). Since some catch data (e.g., sparse data) will lead to errors in certain abundance estimator calculations (e.g., non-convergence), a measure of estimator performance also was calculated as the expected proportion of catch data that allows for reliable bend-level abundance estimates. Each estimator-sampling design combination is therefore associated with a measure of bias, precision, and performance. For each of the three metrics, we computed utilities as values in a common range: 0-1, with values scoring the closest to 1 giving the highest utility (i.e., proportional scoring Conroy and Peterson (2013)). The overall utility of the estimator-sampling design pair is evaluated as the weighted sum of these three utilities, where the weights are determined by the importance of each metric as established by stakeholders. Similarly, the overall utility of a suite of estimators (one abundance estimator, one trend estimator, etc.) for the same sampling design is the weighted mean of the utilities for each estimator. For example, if stakeholders decide that abundance and trend estimates are equally important, then the utility, U, of a particular sampling-estimation design would be calculated as U=0.5<em>U_abund+0.5</em>U_trnd, where U_abund and U_trnd are the utilities of the chosen abundance estimator and the chosen trend estimator under the particular sampling design, respectively. These are standard approaches for valuing outcomes and relating to stakeholder objectives (Clemen et al. 2001, Conroy and Peterson 2013).</p>
<p>Additional valuation will be provided for the remaining fundamental objectives. Specifically, compatibility with legacy data will be quantified as the similarity in bend randomization among designs, provided collaborative population model inputs will be quantified as the proportion of model inputs estimated by design. Lastly, the cost for each sampling design will be evaluated taking several factors into account. While overhead costs are similar for all sampling designs, costs will vary among sampling designs with the number of sampling occasions within a year, the number of deployments per sampling occasion, sampling effort of each deployment, which gears are used, how much training is required for a particular gear, etc. Costs may also vary with estimators or what population characteristics are estimated (gender, age, fecundity, etc), especially if there is a need to purchase advanced equipment or hire staff with a particular set of advanced skills. For example, if an estimate requires samples to be sent out for something like blood-hormone analysis there would be an additional cost to the collection of the samples. Additionally, if the cost of any sampling-estimation design is greater than that allotted for in the budget, then its utility becomes zero since it would not be monetarily feasible to implement such a design.</p>
<p>Potential sampling actions were collected into decision nodes. The decision nodes represent 4 classes of decisions: system-level sampling design, estimator, gear combinations, and measurements taken on individual fish. Alternative system-level sampling designs identified during the workshop and with follow-up stakeholder input are: 1) randomized selections of bends within the segment, 2) randomly selected bends within a segment initially and followed over time, and 3) a spatially balanced design (Stevens and Olsen 2004). Several estimators were identified that could potentially be used to achieve PSPAP fundamental objectives including catch-effort and capture-recapture estimators (e.g., robust design, Cormack-Jolly-Seber, Pradel, closed population estimators). Gears and gear combinations to evaluate were elicited from stakeholders and experts in the system. Lastly, the actions required to measure metrics of interest (e.g., stress, condition) were identified.</p>

<div id="simulate-the-likely-outcomes-for-a-node-conditional-on-influencing-nodes" class="section level2">
<h2>2) Simulate the likely outcomes for a node, conditional on influencing nodes</h2>
<p>Simulation has been used (and is continuing) to generate the outcomes of the alternative monitoring designs. In short, this approach has four steps: simulate a known reference pallid sturgeon population, simulate sampling catch data from the reference population, estimate metrics from the catch data, and compare the estimates to the “true” values used to generate the reference population.</p>
<div id="simulate-a-reference-ps-population" class="section level3">
<h3>1. Simulate a reference PS population</h3>
<p>The pallid sturgeon reference population is initialized using data from the PSPAP database and the pallid sturgeon literature. Each river bend is populated with pallid sturgeon based on expected segment<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>-level densities, while each fish is assigned an initial length and von Bertalanffy growth parameters L_inf and k from segment-level and basin -level distributions, respectively. Individual fish are then tracked for 10 years, recording individual survival status, bend location, and length on a yearly basis. Survival is binomially distributed with fixed parameter f, and growth is projected by individualized von Bertalanffy growth curves. Within-basin movement is based on a pallid sturgeons current bend location with the probability of being in a particular bend the following year increasing as distance to that bend decreases. Immigration and emigration (for example, to/from the Mississippi River) are critical unknowns that can also be evaluated within the reference population. Recruitment occurs randomly with a fixed expected frequency (e.g., every year, every 3 years), and the number of recruits, given there is recruitment, is drawn from a basin-dependent Poisson distribution. Each new recruit is tracked after being randomly assigned an age-0 location within basin, an age-0 length of 200 mm, and von Bertalanffy growth parameters. The population simulation here is generalized from the collaborative pallid sturgeon population model (Jacobson et al, 2016).</p>
</div>
<div id="simulate-sampling-catch-data" class="section level3">
<h3>2. Simulate sampling catch data</h3>
<p>For each of the simulated reference populations, various sampling designs can be implemented to obtain simulated catch data. All sampling designs include segments 2-4, 7-10, 13, and 14, and at a minimum, the number of bends sampled within a segment matches those listed in Table A1 of Welker et al. (2016). The way bends are chosen, however, may vary. In a random sampling design bends within a segment are chosen each year randomly, while in a fixed sampling design they are chosen randomly once and then fixed to be sampled each of the following years. A combination of fixed and random designs can also be implemented, and a spatially balanced design is being considered. Sampling strategies can also differ in the number of sampling occasions (times within a year that each bend is sampled), as well as the number of gear deployments within a particular occasion. Additionally, each sampling design can be implemented with varying gears: gill nets, trammel nets, otter trawls, trotlines, or a combination of these. The catch is simulated from gear-specific catchability values which were bounded to produce plausible overall capture probabilities where catchability is defined as the probability of capture 1 fish per unit effort (Hubert and Fabrizio 2007).</p>
</div>
<div id="estimate-metrics-from-the-catch-data" class="section level3">
<h3>3. Estimate metrics from the catch data</h3>
<p>Once a sampling design is selected, 10 years of occasion-level catch data are simulated for each of the selected bends. Each fish within a selected bend has a probability, P, of being captured. This occasion-level capture probability varies from occasion to occasion, as it is calculated from the individualized deployment catchability and effort values. For each deployment, effort values f are drawn from a gear- and basin-specific gamma distribution, which was fit to PSPAP effort data. Deployment catchability q, or the probability of catching a single fish with one unit of effort, is drawn from a gear-specific distribution. Deployment-specific capture probabilities, p, are calculated as p=q*f and then aggregated to the occasion level to obtain P. When a fish is successfully caught, fish id, location (bend), timing (occasion within year) of catch, gear used, and other important individual attributes (e.g., length, weight, sex) are recorded, simulating a complete capture history at the bend level for the given sampling design.</p>
</div>
<div id="compare-the-estimates-to-the-true-values" class="section level3">
<h3>4. Compare the estimates to the “true” values</h3>
<p>Several catch data simulations are being evaluated per reference population. All estimators are applied to each of the catch data simulations except where sampling design limits the use of an estimator, forcing the application of a smaller subset. Abundance estimates are first computed on the bend-level using various estimators: closed population M_0 and M_t (Otis et al. 1978), Cormack-Jolly-Seber, robust design (Pollock 1982), and catch for single-occasion estimates. Bend-level abundance estimates are then aggregated to the segment-level where estimate uncertainty is calculated using the delta method to index estimate precision (Hilborn and Mangel 1997, Powell 2007). Trend estimates are computed as the slope of the linear model of either annual abundance estimates or annual catch per unit effort for each segment. Alternatively, in absence of recruitment, survival is the same as population trend. Additionally, estimates of other population attributes identified by stakeholders are calculated (e.g., mean length, size structure, condition). The precision, bias, and performance of estimates are calculated and used to parameterize the BDN.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="additional-considerations-and-summary" class="section level1">
<h1>Additional considerations and summary</h1>
<p>The simulation outcomes are being used to parameterize a Bayesian Decision Network (BDN). The BDN can evaluate alternative sampling designs accounting for uncertainty (i.e., the outcomes are not 100% certain). Specifically, in the stochastic simulations described above, many parameter distributions were derived from the PSPAP database or the pallid sturgeon literature. However, mean values and standard deviations for movement probabilities, recruitment frequency, number of recruits, immigration/emigration, and gear catchability are uncertain and not reliably available but can be bound to biologically plausible values. To account for this, reference populations and catch data are simulated for a wide range of mean values for these parameters. A sensitivity analysis will then be used to evaluate the effect of these uncertainties on the results (Conroy and Peterson 2013). For example, it is possible that for all ranges of catchability the robust design has the most utility, and hence management decisions can be made confidently knowing that precise values of catchability will not affect the decision. However, if Strategy A is better given high catchability and Strategy B is better given low catchability, then weve discovered that it is important to learn more about catchability to make a smart decision. Results of sensitivity analyses will inform level 1 or 2 research that may be needed to reduce decision uncertainty. The process used to evaluate alternative monitoring programs is rigorous and allows transparency. Lastly, stakeholder input and objectives have been accommodated throughout the process.</p>
