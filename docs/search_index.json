Within each segment, 25% of bends are randomly sampled annually. Bends may be sampled the following year if selected and there are no fixed reaches that are sampled each year. Missouri River pallid sturgeon recovery is limited to the upper and lower Missouri. River segments, Recovery Priority Management Areas (RPMA) 2 and 4 respectively (Figure 1.1). As part of the Effects Analysis (EA), RPMA 2 and 4 are referred to as the upper and lower basins respectively. Figure 1.1. Major Missouri River pallid sturgeon management units considered as part of the ongoing EA and adaptive management planning. The Pallid Sturgeon Population Assessment Program is implemented in the upper, segmented, and lower Missouri River.

Sampling is required in the segments defined above as part of the PSPAP. Additional segments are identified for major tributaries of the RPMA 2 and 4 and can be sampled as needed. These segments can also specify reservoirs (i.e., segments 51 to 56). The upper basin contains 156 bends and 355 km of river. The lower basin is longer than the upper basin covering 1362 rkm and 338 bends. Bends in the upper and lower basin vary in length and average 2.3 and 4 rkm respectively. The approach evaluated here was designed to inform pallid sturgeon monitoring and assessment objectives and integrate with the Pallid Sturgeon population model. The core of sampling effort is based on a robust design and an integrative population model proposed to serve as the population inventory framework assimilating data needed to estimate parameters for the population model, calibrate catch data, and to provide a check on population estimate trends. The objectives of the population assessment approach described here is to develop and approach that: 1.3 Capture-recapture of marked Individuals Historically, individual Pallid Sturgeon were marked with passive integrated transponder (PIT), radio or acoustic tag. PIT tags provide a way to uniquely identify fish when they are captured, but the amount of information provided by PIT tags is constrained by recapture of the fish. However if a PIT tagged fish is recaptured, it can inform estimates of survival, origin (i.e., natural, hatchery), and growth. Alternatively, fish that are tagged with an acoustic or radio tags can be actively tracked or passively detected, informing migration rates, habitat use, and survival. Using marked fish within a robust design will likely be limited to PIT tagged fish; however use of acoustic or radio tagged fish is discussed below. Design and Understanding from Simulations A preliminary simulation was performed as a proof of concept to evaluate whether a capture-recapture study of individual fish using a robust design would be feasible on a river the size of the Missouri River. First a geographic template was used based on the current PSPAP river bend sampling units, where a river bends are defined as a three continuous habitats (channel cross-over, inside bend, outside bend) and vary in number and size from for the lower and upper basin (Lower: N=317, mean=4 rkm, min=0.2, max=19; Upper: N=157, mean=2.3, min=0.6, max=8). Simulations were performed using the lower basin sampling units as templates. Population dynamics were simulated given known recruitment, survival, and abundance. Given the population dynamics, capture histories were simulated for two levels of capture probability 0.1 and 0.4. These values were selected based on capture probability estimates (Rotella and Hadley 2010, Steffensen et al. 2015). These simulated capture histories were then used to estimate population abundance, survival, and recruitment. The robust design estimator used was the simplest case, assuming homogenous capture probabilities among secondary sampling units and that capture probability was homogenous among bends. The simulation used 5 primary sampling periods and varying secondary sampling occasions (2 through 10) to evaluate estimator performance, reliability, and effort levels. Within a primary sampling occasion at least 2 secondary capture occasions are required to estimate the population using capture-recapture of marked individuals and more are likely needed if heterogeneous capture probabilities are present. Over a spatial extent, sampling at least 20% of the river bends was necessary in preliminary simulations. While this preliminary simulation does not address specific gears, selecting gears and sampling occasions that maximize catch will likely result in reduced effort. Based on preliminary analyses, the population abundance could be estimated (Figure 2). With the exception of a capture probability of 0.1 reasonable abundance estimates were achieve by sampling 20% of the bends if capture probability was 0.4 (Figure 2). If capture probability was 0.1 either more bends needed to be sampled or 6 or greater sampling occasions. There was no appreciable effect of increased secondary occasions to estimate population abundance if capture probability was 0.4. It should be recognized these simulations were conducted under the best case scenario (i.e., homogeneous survival and capture probability) and therefore may not reflect the challenges to sampling a large turbid river like the Missouri River and additional study is required to evaluate ‘worst case’ scenarios. Additional Information to Complete Design This simulation study is preliminary and suggests that a robust design mark recapture approach may be a useful monitoring approach. To fully complete the robust design, a level 1 study should be implemented to evaluate spatial and temporal configurations required to achieve acceptable population and demographic rate estimates. Additionally, if the monitoring program will be used to detect the effect of management actions, a power analysis must be completed. The amount of effort required to provide reasonable estimates should be considered. Lastly, including auxiliary information such as data from tagging arrays or river tracking in an integrated population model will provide a unifying framework incorporating system level monitoring and providing estimates and feedback necessary to parameterize and calibrate the population model. Caveats and considerations There are many assumptions required to estimate population abundance and demographic rates. For example, in this preliminary analysis survival and detection probability was constant among primary and secondary occasions, which is likely a poor assumption. Additionally, factors affecting Pallid Sturgeon survival, such as age, growth, condition were not evaluated and should be accounted for to improve estimates and also capture the effect of these variables on survival such that they can then be potentially linked to management actions. Additional research will be required to evaluate the trade-offs of efforts with estimate bias and precision. Also, evaluation of how sensitive estimates are to violation of assumption will be necessary prior to implementation of monitoring programs. Lastly, the monitoring design will have to be optimized within the constraints of the finite resources available to monitor Pallid Sturgeon on an annual basis, which is not a trivial task in a large turbid system like the Missouri River.

There are 3 major sections providing the results of simulations to evaluate estimating 1) abundance, 2) demographic rates, and 3) abundance and demographic rates. Within each section the results of analysis are provided with increasing complexity. The results of simple analyses provide the foundation for more complex analyses that may be robust to violation of assumptions, which is likely in the Missouri River. Therefore analyses can be viewed as an iterative process and early iterations are retained in this document for foundation and transparency.

Specifically, the base survivals are simulated using the equation \\[\\Phi_{stage} = \\frac{exp(\\beta_0)}{1+exp(\\beta_0)},\\] Where \\(\\beta_0\\) represents the expected survival on logit scale. For example, adult survival is expected 3.2 Pradel model 3.2.1 Background The information contained in capture histories informs the survival from one time interval to the next. This information when viewed in reverse order contains information on entry into the population. Specifically, prior to being captured a critter is either at large (present but not captured) or not present (i.e., unborn). Therefore looking at capture histories in reverse order estimates recruitment. Typical with capture-mark-recapture approaches estimated parameters can be estimated and related to covariates. The Pradel model originally developed by Pradel back in the 70s estimates survival and recruitment using this reversal symmetry. Essentially, when looking at a capture history of a fish in reverse with particular examination of the preceding 0s. Suppose a capture history of a fish is 00010101, on the first 3 occasions a fish could be alive and not captured or waiting to be born. Using this information a cmr program may be able to simultaneously model survival and recruitment. This is appealing because recruitment can be thought of simply surviving age-0 or age-1 which can be related to covariates. Thinking outside of the box on this one might be able to model the effect of environmental covariates hypothesized to influence recruitment. The objective of this brief is to explore whether this might make sense. It is not a full proof of concept but a simple what if. Therefore the usual caveats are at work here, specifically this might work well on a computer but may fail miserably in the field. 3.2.2 Simulating some known data. To test the approach we need to simulate some data from some known parameters. The Pradel model estimates \\(\\phi\\), \\(p\\), and \\(f\\), where these values represent survival, capture probability, and recruitment rate. For the simulation I simulated 10 occasions, could be 10 years, 10 months, so on. Survival \\(\\phi\\) was set at 0.8 Capture probability \\(p\\) was set at 0.3 Recruitment rate \\(f\\) was set at 0.195 (i.e., Recruits = \\(f\\)*Abundance) Initial population was set to be 2000 critters The code above simulates a population of individuals given a recruitment rate where the number of recruits is a function of the population in this case. It may not be in some cases and this can be account for in the Pradel formulation. Now we can look at the ‘true’ population dynamics. Now we can use the ‘true’ population dynamics to simulate the capture process and make some capture histories. In the capture histories there are fish that were present but not captured, we need to drop those from the histories. The library ‘Rmark’ gets us access to program mark through R which we can we to set up the capture histories and design matrices. Now that the data is all set up we can feed some formulas for \\(\\phi\\), \\(p\\), and \\(f\\) to MARK for estimation. These are all time invariant formulations (i.e.,\\(\\phi\\), \\(p\\), and \\(f\\) are constant over time). You can also recast the model to estimate lambda. Neat, the lambdas for each year are XXXXX with a 95% CIs of xxxxx. That seems reasonable the population looks to be decreasing over time and hence lambda &lt; 1. 3.3 Application to AM and the big picture The potential application of this is linking management actions to demographic rates. For example suppose over the 10 years IRC habitat was constructed and hypothesized to influence recruitment. Well in this case we can simulate that is in fact the case. First we need to set up the relation between IRC and recruitment rate. The effect is modeled using a log link. For this example the baseline recruitment rate is 0.26 (the log of that is -1.33) and is the intercept of the equation. The effect of IRC, which might be measured in area is 0.003. Putting those together the equation to predict recruitment rate is \\(f= exp(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} \\cdot IRC)\\) The code below implements this for some IRC values. The predicted recruitment as a function of IRC looks like the figure below. 3.3.1 Fitting a covariate to recruitment Using the same code to simulate a population with constant \\(\\phi\\) as above but now allowing \\(f\\) to vary over time as a function of IRC we can simulate the population data. The population dynamics are plotted below. Now that we have the true population data we can simulate the capture histories given \\(p\\) Some processing of the simulated data to feed to MARK. Now we can do as we did previously but now there is a new bit relating \\(f\\) to IRC f.irc=list(formula=~irc+1). Well the estimates look good, I fed the simulation a \\(\\beta_{0} = r B_0\\) and got back coef(m1)[3,1]. For the effect of IRC I used a \\(\\beta_{1} = r B_irc\\) and got back r coef(m1)[4,1]. Estimates and true values will not exactly match but will improve with more occasions, recaptures, and so on. A information theoretic approach could be used to evaluate the effect of IRC versus no effect of IRC. With AICc values of r round(summary(m1)\\(AICc,2) and r round(summary(m2)\\)AICc,2) for m1 and m2 respectively there might be some weak evidence for an effect of IRC. 3.3.2 Fitting a covariate to lambda Using the same approach we can fit a covariate to lamba. This is not as directly interpretable but simply illustrates the approach. 3.4 Caveats This approach may be useful, or not, but may warrant consideration. The approach will not get at abundance and therefor will not be useful for getting at some objectives. It is dependent on many assumptions and conditions and as we all know working on a big river throws some big monkey wrenches. This simulation made a number of simplifying assumptions, constant \\(\\phi\\), constant \\(p\\) which may be relaxed to a degree. The consequence of violating the assumptions is always problematic. 3.5 CJS ;lkasjdflkjasd asdlkfj;alskdjfasdf aslkdjf;laskjdf;lkjasdf asdfl;kja;lskdjf;lasjkdf "],
["estimating-pallid-sturgeon-abundance-and-demographic-rates.html", "Chapter 4 Estimating Pallid Sturgeon Abundance and Demographic Rates 4.1 Robust Design Overview", " Chapter 4 Estimating Pallid Sturgeon Abundance and Demographic Rates 4.1 Robust Design Overview The population assessment approach proposed is what is referred to as a robust design (Pollock 1982, Kendall 1997). As originally described by Pollock (1982), a robust design consists of primary sampling occasions with secondary sampling occasions nested with the primary sampling occasion. Primary occasions are spaced temporally to capture processes such as survival and growth. Secondary occasions occur over a short time frame, short enough that closure of the population from demographic processes (i.e., recruitment, mortality, immigration, emigration) can be assumed. The secondary sampling occasions also provide multiple opportunities for individuals to be captured, allowing for the estimation of capture probability providing an estimate of the population rather than an index of relative abundance. True abundance estimates are important to ongoing adaptive management and recovery because species recovery objectives and sub objectives are specified as abundance and population growth rate ($$) is estimated as \\(\\lambda ={{N}_{t+1}}/{{N}_{t}}\\) where \\(N\\) is population abundance. The robust sampling design has been applied across a wide range of taxa to estimate demographic rates and population abundance. The robust design was originally conceived to provide a robust population estimates derived from open capture-recapture models, the Jolly Seber model in particular. Its use has been extended to studies of species occurrence (i.e., occupancy models; MacKenzie et al. 2002, Tyre et al. 2003) and abundance (N-mixture models; Royle 2004b, Royle 2004a) of unmarked individuals. Therefore it provides a rigorous framework that allows for the estimation of relevant demographic rates and abundance, using marked or unmarked individuals. It should be recognized that monitoring Pallid Sturgeon in a system as large as the Missouri River is inherently challenging and it is likely that any approached used will violate an assumption required to estimate demographic rates or population abundance. The following sections provide a preliminary overview of the robust design as a potential monitoring design for Pallid Sturgeon populations of the Upper and Lower Missouri River. "],

The location of individual Pallid Sturgeon were tracked during each time step and moved to a new bend, conditional on survival and previous bend location assuming a multinomial distirubtion as, Loc_{j,t+t}~Multinomial(p_{I,.,t} Where variables and indices are defined in table xx. The vector of probabilities \\(p_{I,.,t}\\) predicts the probable location given the previous bend location. This approach to movement provided a flexible approach to modeling movement that can be readily related to management actions. Specifically, $p_{I,j,t} is an array of probabilities with each row summing to one forming a 12 transition matrices providing the probility of moving from bend \\(i\\) to bend \\(j\\). This array of probabilities provides a plugin location for movement. The diagonal represents the probability of remaining in the same reach, off diagonal elements represent downstream or upstream movements. 5.4 Management effects on movement The effect of management actions on movement or drift of adult or larval Pallid Sturgeon respectively can be simulated by modifying monthly transition matrices. For example, suppose that adult Pallid Sturgeon migrate upstream given a flow or temperature cue. This directed movement can be simulated by specifying the probability of a fish moving to downstream bends equal to 0 and upstream bends greather than 0. Similarly, the effect of flow on free embryo drift can be simulated with increased downstream probabilities. Y_{I,j,t+1}=_0 + 1 Q{I,j,t} for i&lt;=j i&gt;j = 0 Current model implementation requires an array of transitions for each timestep. Future model versions will attempt to reefing the linke between environmental covariates like flow such that a time series of predicted flows can be used as as inputs. The relationship between movement and varying covariates may take the form of a model prediction given previous location. For example, movement in terms of kilometers could be modeled \\(rkm_{t+1} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot Q + \\beta_2 \\cdot rkm_t + \\beta_3 \\cdot Q \\cdot rkm_t + \\sigma\\). The equation predicts how far, on average, a pallid sturgeon will move given an effect of flow and current location. The interaction term accounts for the effect of location (i.e., fish cannot move as far if they are near the uppermost bends). "],

Hypothesis driven monitoring and research also will be required to assess specific management actions. Monitoring data provides three inputs to the decision making process and adaptive management. First, monitoring data provides information which in turn reduces uncertainty of the current state of the system (i.e., abundance of Pallid Sturgeon). This is important as management decisions likely depend on the current state of the system. For example, the level of population augmentation (i.e., stocking) required to meet sub-objectives will likely depend on population abundance. Second, monitoring data provides feedback necessary to evaluate implemented system-level management decisions (level 3) as part of the adaptive management process, albeit it may take many years to realize a system level effect in monitoring data. In this case, the effect a management action on the population is predicted and monitoring data provides the necessary feedback to evaluate whether the predicted population response was realized. Management action specific monitoring also is required to evaluate management actions that may not be detectable at the system level (e.g., effect of IRC on free embryo and exogenously feeding larval Pallid Sturgeon survival). Lastly monitoring is necessary to determine whether population objectives and sub-objectives have been met. Challenges exist to using monitoring data that provides a relative index of the population for adaptive management and decision making. Specifically, previous PSPAP monitoring indexed population abundance by catch per unit effort (CPUE), which assumes that CPUE is proportional to abundance and catchability is constant over time and space (Harley et al. 2001). Catch effort data can exhibit patterns of hyper-stability where catch suggests population abundance is higher than it actually is or hyper-depletion where catch suggests population abundance is lower than it actually is. The use of catch per effort data also conflicts with population objectives of 5,000 individual Pallid Sturgeon in each management unit. Calibration of CPUE to Pallid Sturgeon abundance is necessary to determine whether this sub-objective has been met. The value of uncalibrated CPUE data can be of limited value in a decision making context if fundamental objectives focus on population abundance rather than relative abundance, especially if relative indexes are biases. The use of varying sources of information (Level 1 and 2 science, process and implementation monitoring, and system level monitoring) in a decision making context presents a final challenge to the adaptive management process. The model developed to simulate population dynamics and evaluate management actions provides a flexible framework to evaluate the consequences of management actions on population dynamics and growth ($$; defined as \\({{N}_{t+1}}/{{N}_{t}}\\)). The effects of management actions are propagated to the population through effects to demographic rates, survival in this case. In many cases baseline survival is unknown with a high degree of uncertainty and the effect of a management action on survival is an additional unknown. These unknowns may be parameterized by expert elicitation, existing values, or by model calibration. As the adaptive management process moves forward additional information will become available that will refine and ideally improve the survival rates and associated uncertainties. These values may become available as a result of controlled experiments or field studies and this information should be assimilated and incorporated in a manner that results in a useable input such that the population model can be used as a decision support tool.

["assimilation-and-integrating-monitoring-research-and-management.html", "Chapter 8 Assimilation and integrating monitoring, research and management", " Chapter 8 Assimilation and integrating monitoring, research and management Integrating monitoring with the adaptive management plan will pose challenge in a decision making context. In particular, the adaptive management plan utilizes multiple sources of information at varying scales of implementation (Level 1 and 2, Process and implementation). Level 1 study consists of small scale experiments and information learned from these studies may not adequately scale to the population level. For example, scientific studies conducted in ponds, flumes, or under controlled laboratory conditions may not generalize to the population level. However this information is important to synthesize an incorporate into decision making and adaptive management as these values may be the only source of that can inform demographic rates used in the population model. A formal framework to integrate information acquired from studies at the varying levels has not been developed and represents a challenge to integrate information across study levels. The exact nature of a framework to integrate what is learned from levels of studies in the AM plan is uncertain. One approach that has been used to combine sources of information is Bayes Theorem, which can assimilate prior and current information into a posterior distribution of values. This approach is potentially useful because it can be used in either a scenario planning approach (i.e., evaluating scenarios through a model) or in a decision model such as a Bayesian Decision Network (BDN) (Nyberg et al. 2006). This section provides an example of how Bayes Theorem is used to update a distribution of survivals for embryos and some potentially usefly applications of BDNs to assimilate and incorporate information learned from studies at varying levels in a decision making context. It should be recognized that this is one approach that shows promise and is commonly used in a decision making context, but there may be other approaches that are more suitable, however are yet unidentified. Suppose that prior to any level of study, survival of embryos to free embryos (\\({{\\phi }_{embryo}}\\)) was believed to be some value with some measure of uncertainty. This value and associated uncertainty can be derived by literature review or expert elicitation. In this hypothetical example, suppose the initial value and associated uncertainty for embryo survival (\\({{\\phi }_{embryo}}\\)) was determined by expert elicitation. An approach to perform the elicitation would be to have experts adjust the parameters of the equation\\[\\text{logit}({{\\phi }_{embryo}})={{\\beta }_{0}}+\\varepsilon \\], where \\(\\beta_0\\) is the expected survival on logit scale and $$ is a normally distributed error term controlling the uncertainty around \\(\\phi_{embryo}\\). If the results of this hypothetical elicitation were \\({{\\beta }_{0}}=-12.1\\) and \\(\\varepsilon =0.2\\), the resulting distribution of \\({{\\phi }_{embryo}}\\) is illustrated in Figure 1. This distribution of \\({{\\phi }_{embryo}}\\) values can then be used in stochastic population simulations to evaluate population dynamics and viability over the long term. Model parameterized by expert elicitation provides a rapid framework to evaluate the effect of management actions in an objective that otherwise may take months to years or may be impossible to estimate. Sensitivity analysis provides a method to evaluate how dependent model outcomes are on these inputs and potentially guide research and monitoring. As the adaptive management plan moves forward, studies at varying levels will further inform demographic parameters like \\({{\\phi }_{embryo}}\\). For example, suppose a study is implemented that provides estimates of embryo survival based on a flume study and survival was estimated from the same logit linear model where \\({{\\beta }_{0}}=-11.5\\) and \\(\\varepsilon =0.1\\) which is illustrated in Figure 1. This study, while not at the scale of the entire system, provides additional information on embryo survival and can be incorporated and assimilated using Bayes theorem to update the distribution of survival values resulting from expert elicitation (Hilborn and Mangel 1997, Clemen et al. 2001, Conroy and Peterson 2013). Incorporating and assimilation the information results in a posterior distribution representing the assimilation of the two information sources illustrated in Figure 1. Population model simulations can then be conducted using the new distribution of survivals assimilating expert elicitation and monitoring results. "],
["power-of-monitoring-data-to-detect-management-effect.html", "Chapter 9 Power of monitoring data to detect management effect", " Chapter 9 Power of monitoring data to detect management effect Effective monitoring is a critical component to detecting the effect of and providing feedback of level 3 management actions implemented on the system. Therefore a monitoring program has to be designed to provide sufficient power to detect the effect of management actions. In most research studies, power is typically set such that the sampling program detects an a priori effect size 80% of the time. In the case of Pallid Sturgeon, management actions are believed to effect population demographic rates, which are illustrated in the CEMs. Many of these responses are on survival which is bound by 0 and 1. Given the bounds on survivals, effects are likely asymmetrical which can complicate simple power analyses. For example, a 10% increase or decrease in an adult survival (\\({{\\phi }_{adult}}\\)) of 0.92 is 1.012 and 0.828 respectively. The 10% increase results in survival exceeding 100%, highlighting the challenge of power analysis to reliably detect biologically meaningful effects due to constrained parameter space. Lastly, suitable effect size should be determined a priori, however the practical realities of finite sampling resources will likely limit the reliable detection of an effect, unless the effect is large (i.e., it is easier to detect large effects with less effort). Simulation studies will be required to evaluate whether detecting effects of varying magnitudes is feasible. "],
["value-of-monitoring-data.html", "Chapter 10 Value of monitoring data", " Chapter 10 Value of monitoring data A challenge facing monitoring programs is how much data is sufficient to make a decision and in the context of finite sampling resources. The value of information can be meaningful in decision contexts where multiple sources of information are assembled to reduce uncertainty around current system state or functional relationships (Conroy and Peterson 2013, Canessa et al. 2015). If a BDN is developed, the network contains a utility that corresponds to an objective, the value of various sources of information, perfect or imperfect (i.e., monitoring data), can be calculated (Moore and Runge 2012, Conroy and Peterson 2013, Canessa et al. 2015). Additionally, in cases where there are multiple metrics that require monitoring but resources preclude monitoring all metrics, a value of information analysis can facilitate prioritization of monitoring efforts in the context of making a decision. For example, the number of Pallid Sturgeon 50 years in the future depends on the current number of Pallid Sturgeon. However, there is uncertainty in current Pallid Sturgeon abundance estimates that could be reduced by monitoring. Similarly, there also is uncertainty in survival rates that could be reduced by monitoring or additional research. How finite monitoring and research resources are allocated (e.g., does an agency target abundance or survival) to reduce uncertainty can be informed by a value of information analysis. This type of analysis when performed in conjunction with a sensitivity analysis can provide a framework to determine how valuable information acquired from monitoring and research is, but it requires BDN which in turn requires a set of decision alternatives and a utility.

["caveats-and-considerations.html", "Chapter 11 Caveats and considerations 11.1 Figures", " Chapter 11 Caveats and considerations The approach illustrated in the two hypothetical examples is one approach that may be used to assimilate and incorporate information from varying monitoring designs and levels of study in the adaptive management process. This approach is easily used in a BDN framework as well as in scenario modeling, providing support to using the population model for scenario planning or decision support. As demonstrated in the example, attention needs to be applied to studies such that analyses can be assimilated. Specifically one needs to be able to combine information based off a distribution or predictive model. Additional consideration should be given to how much belief or weight is given each information source, if this approach is applied. For example, should data from mesocosm experiments receive similar or twice the weight of expert elicitations? What about in relation to field level studies and implementations? Assimilating and incorporating varying information sources that will arise from the AM plan will be a challenge requiring careful consideration as to how results will fit together with the population model to support for decision analysis and scenario planning. 11.1 Figures Figure 1.
