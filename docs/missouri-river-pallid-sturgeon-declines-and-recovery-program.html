<p>The objectives of the Pallid Sturgeon Population Assessment Program are:</p>
<p>Objectives 1. Evaluate annual results and long-term trends in pallid sturgeon population abundance and geographic distribution throughout the Missouri River System. 2. Evaluate annual results and long-term trends of habitat usage of pallid sturgeon and hatchery-stocked pallid sturgeon by season and life stage. 3. Evaluate population structure and dynamics of pallid sturgeon in the Missouri River system. 4. Evaluate annual results and long-term trends in the population abundance of native target species and geographic distribution throughout the Missouri River system. These target species include: shovelnose sturgeon (<em>Scaphirhynchus platorynchus</em>), blue sucker (<em>Cycleptus elongates</em>), sauger (<em>Zander canadense</em>), plains and Western silvery minnows (<em>Hybognathus</em> spp.), sand shiner (<em>Notropis stramineus</em>), and three main channel inhabiting cyprinids in the genus <em>Macrhybopsis</em>. These three species, sturgeon chub (<em>M. gelida</em>), sicklefin chub (<em>M. meeki</em>), and speckled chub (<em>M. aestivalis</em>), are the main forage for piscivorous pallid sturgeon and are rare themselves in some sections of the Missouri River. 5. Evaluate annual results and long-term trends of habitat usage of the target native species by season and life stage. 6. Evaluate annual results and long-term trends in all remaining species (minimum of 50 fish collected/species) population abundance and geographic distribution throughout the Missouri River system.</p>

<p>The upper basin contains 156 bends and 355 km of river. The lower basin is longer than the upper basin covering 1362 rkm and 338 bends. Bends in the upper and lower basin vary in length and average 2.3 and 4 rkm respectively.</p>
<p>The approach evaluated here was designed to inform pallid sturgeon monitoring and assessment objectives and integrate with the Pallid Sturgeon population model. The core of sampling effort is based on a robust design and an integrative population model proposed to serve as the population inventory framework assimilating data needed to estimate parameters for the population model, calibrate catch data, and to provide a check on population estimate trends. The objectives of the population assessment approach described here is to develop and approach that:</p>

<div id="capture-recapture-of-marked-individuals" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Capture-recapture of marked Individuals</h2>
<p>Historically, individual Pallid Sturgeon were marked with passive integrated transponder (PIT), radio or acoustic tag. PIT tags provide a way to uniquely identify fish when they are captured, but the amount of information provided by PIT tags is constrained by recapture of the fish. However if a PIT tagged fish is recaptured, it can inform estimates of survival, origin (i.e., natural, hatchery), and growth. Alternatively, fish that are tagged with an acoustic or radio tags can be actively tracked or passively detected, informing migration rates, habitat use, and survival. Using marked fish within a robust design will likely be limited to PIT tagged fish; however use of acoustic or radio tagged fish is discussed below. Design and Understanding from Simulations A preliminary simulation was performed as a proof of concept to evaluate whether a capture-recapture study of individual fish using a robust design would be feasible on a river the size of the Missouri River. First a geographic template was used based on the current PSPAP river bend sampling units, where a river bends are defined as a three continuous habitats (channel cross-over, inside bend, outside bend) and vary in number and size from for the lower and upper basin (Lower: N=317, mean=4 rkm, min=0.2, max=19; Upper: N=157, mean=2.3, min=0.6, max=8).</p>
<p>Simulations were performed using the lower basin sampling units as templates. Population dynamics were simulated given known recruitment, survival, and abundance. Given the population dynamics, capture histories were simulated for two levels of capture probability 0.1 and 0.4. These values were selected based on capture probability estimates (Rotella and Hadley 2010, Steffensen et al. 2015). These simulated capture histories were then used to estimate population abundance, survival, and recruitment. The robust design estimator used was the simplest case, assuming homogenous capture probabilities among secondary sampling units and that capture probability was homogenous among bends. The simulation used 5 primary sampling periods and varying secondary sampling occasions (2 through 10) to evaluate estimator performance, reliability, and effort levels. Within a primary sampling occasion at least 2 secondary capture occasions are required to estimate the population using capture-recapture of marked individuals and more are likely needed if heterogeneous capture probabilities are present. Over a spatial extent, sampling at least 20% of the river bends was necessary in preliminary simulations. While this preliminary simulation does not address specific gears, selecting gears and sampling occasions that maximize catch will likely result in reduced effort. Based on preliminary analyses, the population abundance could be estimated (Figure 2). With the exception of a capture probability of 0.1 reasonable abundance estimates were achieve by sampling 20% of the bends if capture probability was 0.4 (Figure 2). If capture probability was 0.1 either more bends needed to be sampled or 6 or greater sampling occasions. There was no appreciable effect of increased secondary occasions to estimate population abundance if capture probability was 0.4. It should be recognized these simulations were conducted under the best case scenario (i.e., homogeneous survival and capture probability) and therefore may not reflect the challenges to sampling a large turbid river like the Missouri River and additional study is required to evaluate ‘worst case’ scenarios. Additional Information to Complete Design This simulation study is preliminary and suggests that a robust design mark recapture approach may be a useful monitoring approach. To fully complete the robust design, a level 1 study should be implemented to evaluate spatial and temporal configurations required to achieve acceptable population and demographic rate estimates. Additionally, if the monitoring program will be used to detect the effect of management actions, a power analysis must be completed. The amount of effort required to provide reasonable estimates should be considered. Lastly, including auxiliary information such as data from tagging arrays or river tracking in an integrated population model will provide a unifying framework incorporating system level monitoring and providing estimates and feedback necessary to parameterize and calibrate the population model. Caveats and considerations There are many assumptions required to estimate population abundance and demographic rates. For example, in this preliminary analysis survival and detection probability was constant among primary and secondary occasions, which is likely a poor assumption. Additionally, factors affecting Pallid Sturgeon survival, such as age, growth, condition were not evaluated and should be accounted for to improve estimates and also capture the effect of these variables on survival such that they can then be potentially linked to management actions. Additional research will be required to evaluate the trade-offs of efforts with estimate bias and precision. Also, evaluation of how sensitive estimates are to violation of assumption will be necessary prior to implementation of monitoring programs. Lastly, the monitoring design will have to be optimized within the constraints of the finite resources available to monitor Pallid Sturgeon on an annual basis, which is not a trivial task in a large turbid system like the Missouri River.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> About this report</h2>
<p>This report steps through simulations to evaluate potential PSPAP designs that align with the the fundamental objectives outlined by the XXXXXX and described above. There are 3 major sections providing the results of simulations to evaluate estimating 1) abundance, 2) demographic rates, and 3) abundance and demographic rates. Within each section the results of analysis are provided with increasing complexity. The results of simple analyses provide the foundation for more complex analyses that may be robust to violation of assumptions, which is likely in the Missouri River. Therefore analyses can be viewed as an iterative process and early iterations are retained in this document for foundation and transparency.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.6</span> Habitat Assessment and Monitoring Project (HAMP)</h2>
<p>The HAMP focuses on assessing the physical and biological responses of habitat creation efforts in the channelized Missouri River. Physical responses are characterized by diversity of depth, velocity, slope, substrate, etc., while biological responses are characterized by various metrics related to pallid sturgeon and a series of native target species (i.e., sicklefin chubs, sturgeon chubs, speckled chubs, plains and western silvery minnow, young of the year blue sucker and sauger).</p>
<div id="objectives-of-the-project" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.6.1</span> Objectives of the Project</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Evaluate annual and multi-year trends in physical diversity (i.e., depth, velocity, substrate) and change in modified sites relative to control sites over time (a control site is a site that remains as unmodified from its current status).</li>
<li>Evaluate annual and multi-year trends of fish metrics (i.e., catch per unit effort, presence/absence) of pallid sturgeon and target species between modified and control sites.</li>
