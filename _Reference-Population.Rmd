# Overview
<!-- IF WE NEED A MORE DETAILED INTRO WE CAN SAY SOMETHING LIKE:
We used a Bayesian Decision Network (BDN) to evaluate alternative PSPAP monitoring designs (Marcot et al. 2001, Nyberg et al. 2006, Conroy and Peterson 2013). The development and parameterization of the BDN required two steps (see ??).  The second step was to stochastically simulate the outcomes of the alternative monitoring designs. In short, the process that we used (and continue to use) to generate monitoring design outcomes involves four steps (see ??), the first of which is to simulate known reference pallid sturgeon populations. Therefore...pick up with what follows-->

A set of reference populations of known pallid sturgeon abundance is needed to 
evaluate varying monitoring designs and their ability to achieve the 
fundamental objectives identified during the first population assessment
program workshop (See Section ??). A reference population provides 
data on the annual survival and movement of each fish in the population
(including new recruits) at the bend-level (Figure 1). Since fish length may 
influence sampling effectiveness (e.g. gear selectivity), data on 
individuals (e.g., growth) was also simulated. 


### Objectives

The objectives of this analysis were to:
1. Create a spatially explicit pallid sturgeon population with known 
bend-level annual abundances, 
2. Simulate reference population dynamics for 10 years with varying but 
known annual survival, individual growth, movement, and recruitment, and
3. Allow movement and recruitment to vary over a wide range of biologically 
reasonable conditions in order to better understand their relationship with
monitoring design outcomes.

### Major Assumptions

1. Survival probability is homogeneous among all individuals and 
independent of space and time.
2. Individual fish growth follows a von Bertalanffy growth equation.
3. There is no movement within years.
4. Movement within a basin can occur between years.
5. Recruitment occurs at the basin-level and is stochastic.

<!--(DISCUSS THE VALIDITY OF EACH ASSUMPTION HERE... WOULD LIKE TO SAY 
SOMETHING LIKE:-->

Assumptions 1 and 2 are reasonable simplifications for the purposes of 
this evaluation and have been used in various fish studies (CITATIONS...
NOT SURE IF THIS IS TRUE; NEED TO ASK MIKE AND LOOK AT LITERATURE).  Assumptions 3 and 4 match the assumptions of many closed population 
estimators from mark-recapture estimation to robust design estimation. Making these assumptions allows for the evaluation of such estimators 
under the best possible movement conditions---if an estimator performs 
poorly under the best movement conditions, then its use in less 
favorable movement conditions is further questionable.  Lastly, since 
recruitment is expected to vary from year to year and fish are expected 
to migrate to spawning habitats within basin (and not necessarily stay 
in particular bends), assumption 5 is appropriate for studying pallid 
sturgeon.  For a more detailed examination of these assumptions see the 
"Discussion" section.

<!--...BUT  NEED TO LOOK INTO!/CHAT WITH MIKE ABOUT.)-->


# Methods

### Spatial extent and grain

This analysis was constrained to generate reference pallid sturgeon 
populations for segments and bends within the upper basin (segments 1-4)
and lower basin (segments 7-10, 13 and 14) of the Missouri River. Bends 
of varying length were used to generate the spatial distribution of 
pallid sturgeon (Table 1).


### Population Initialization

The pallid sturgeon reference population was initialized using data from
the PSPAP database and the pallid sturgeon literature. Population 
initialization required xx steps: 1. initializing bend-level abundance, 
2. initializing lengths and growth parameters of individuals within each 
bend, 3. assigning demographic rates (i.e., sex, origin). 

#### Bend Abundance

We populated each river bend with pallid sturgeon based on expected 
segment-level densities by origin (Table 2). The number of pallid 
sturgeon assigned to a bend was stochastically generated from a Poisson 
distribution given the segment density and bend length as:


$$N_{segment,bend}\sim 
Poisson\left(\sum_{origin}\lambda_{segment,origin}\cdot 
l_{segment,bend}\right),\text{(1)}$$

where 
 
* $N$ is the number of pallid sturgeon within each bend,
* $\lambda$ is the segment and origin specific density in fish per RKM,
* $l$ is bend length in RKM,
* $segment$ indexes segment within universe,
* $bend$ indexes bend within segment, and
* $origin$ indexes whether pallid sturgeon were hatchery or natural 
origin.

Generating bend abundances from a Poisson distribution allows for 
variation in bend densities among bends within segment while 
guaranteeing that the bend is populated with a whole number of fish.  Additionally, one could derive a spatial Poisson distribution with the 
following assumptions:

1. The probability of 1 pallid being in a column of water with length 
$dl$ and the width of the river at RKM $l$ is $\alpha$.
2. The probability of 2 or more pallid sturgeon in a column of water 
with length $dl$ is negligible $o(\varepsilon)$.
3. The number of pallid sturgeon in disjoint (non-overlapping) water 
columns $dl_1$ and $dl_2$ are independent.  In other words the presence 
or absence of a fish in water column 1 does not effect the probability 
of a fish being present in water column 2, even if these two water 
columns are adjacent to each other. 

<!--WORKS BETTER WITH $dA$ BUT WE DON'T HAVE WIDTHS... COULD ASSUME AN 
APPROXIMATELY CONSTANT WIDTH AMONG BENDS WITHIN SEGMENT TO ACHIEVE THIS. 
MECNOTE-we can 
get widths-->


#### Assigning length and growth parameters to individuals

We randomly assigned an initial length to each individual fish.  Initial 
lengths were generated from a segment specific distribution constructed 
from recent (2015-??) PSPAP database length data.  Only pallid sturgeon data 
where both length and weight were reported as non-negative values were used. 
Additionally, data points that were residual outliers to the log-log regression 
of weight and length were excluded from the analysis.  Lastly, only lengths 
greater than 200mm were included in the analysis.  Lengths 200mm or less were 
considered to be from age-0 pallid sturgeon and these fish would instead be 
added to the reference population through an analysis of next year's 
recruitment (described in a later section below).  

The cleaned up data was then analyzed by segment.  For each segment, a numerical
inverse cummulative distribution function for length was generated by 
interpolating between the percentiles of the length data for the given segment.
This was achieved using "approxfun" in R's stats package.  Inverse cummulative 
distribution functions take a probability value between 0 and 1 as input and 
output a length value. Therefore, we were able to generate an individual's initial 
length by using a uniformly sampled probability value as input to the inverse 
cummulative distribution function associated with the individual's segment.

Additionally, we assigned individual von Bertalanffy growth parameters 
$L_\infty$ and $k$, or the asymptotic length and Brody growth 
coefficient of a fish's growth trajectory, respectively, to each fish.  Growth parameters were generated from a basin specific bivariate normal 
distribution fitted to the length data in the PSPAP database.  (FURTHER
DESCRIPTION HERE; NEED MIKE TO DO SINCE NOT SURE HOW DONE) <!--MECNOTE:
on my todo list now-->

To avoid unrealistic growth parameter values we truncated each bivariate 
normal distribution (one for each basin) to the middle 80%.  All points 
$(L_\infty, k)$ of the truncated distribution are contained on or within
an ellipse centered at $\mathbf{\mu}=(\mu_{L_\infty}, \mu_k)$, the basin
specific mean values for $L_\infty$ and $k$.  Since the R package 
$\texttt{tmvtnorm}$ truncates multivariate normal distributions to
rectangular regions, as opposed to elliptical regions, we used a 
different approach to randomly draw points from the desired elliptical
region.  

In short, we first drew points from the middle 80% of a standard 
bivariate normal distribution and then transformed these points to the
bivariate normal distribution of interest, giving us randomly drawn 
points that fall on or within the 80% ellipse.  The truncation process 
was achieved using $\texttt{rtruncnorm}$ twice in R, once for the normal
distribution associated with $L_\infty$ and then again for the normal 
distribution associated with $k$ conditional on $L_\infty$.  For more
details see Appendix ??.  


### Simulating Annual Transitions
After initializing the reference population, we track all individual 
fish for 10 years, recording individual survival status, bend location,
and length on a yearly basis.  Additionally, new recruits may be added 
to the population and tracked.  

#### Survival & Growth
Survival is stochastic but simulated with a survival probability that is 
homogeneous among individuals with all fish in the river having an equal 
probability, $\phi$, of surviving the year.  Survival probability is 
independent of individual age, length, sex, origin, location, and year. 
In other words, each year individual fish survival is a Bernoulli trial
with fixed probability of success, $\phi$. 

Annual growth is projected by individual von Bertalanffy growth curves 
as
 
$$ L(t+1)=L(t)+(L_\infty-L(t))(1-e^{-k}), \text{(2)}$$

where $L(t)$ is the individual's length during year $t$ and each fish 
has its own randomly generated asymptotic length, $L_\infty$, and Brody
growth rate, $k$, as described in the previous section on initializing 
the population.  


#### Movement
Within basin movement occurs between years and is considered at the 
bend-level.  Pallid sturgeon may move from one bend to another bend 
within the same segment, from one bend to another bend within a 
different segment (but same basin), or stay within the same bend.  Movement probabilities are based on current bend locations with the
probability of being in bend $j$ the following year increasing as the
distance between the fish's current bend and bend $j$ decreases.  In 
particular, 

$$\mathbb{P}\Big(B(t)=j \quad | \quad  B(t-1)=i\Big)=\frac{e^{-\beta d(i, j)}}{\sum_k e^{-\beta d(i, k)}},$$

<!--
$$\mathbb{P}\Big(B(t)=j \quad | \quad  B(t-1)=i\Big)=\frac{f(i,j)}{\sum_k f(i,k)},$$
and 
$$\begin{cases} 
      1, & k=i \\
      e^{\beta_0-\beta_1 d(i, k)}, & k\neq i
   \end{cases},$$
-->
where $i$, $j$, and $k$ are particular bends, $B(t)$ is the individual's bend location in year $t$,  $d(i, k)$ is the distance in river kilometers (RKM) from the center of bend $i$ 
to the center of bend $k$, and $\beta$ is a basin specific 
parameter.  

(NEED JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS...I HAVE SOME IDEAS FOR WHAT WE MIGHT WANT TO DO WITH
MOVEMENT MOVING FORWARD)

To account for the uncertain nature of movement probabilities, we vary $\beta$ from
simulation to simulation, allowing the analysis of populations that range in having 
high site fidelity to low site fidelity.  Lastly, we also simulated reference 
populations that do not move, i.e. individuals always remain within the same bend during 
the sampling season.  


#### Recruitment

Each year recruitment was determined by two factors: (1) whether or not spawning that 
led to successful recruitment occurred and (2) given recruitment occurred, how many 
age-0 fish survived to age-1 (number of recruits).  Recruitment years occurred with 
a fixed expected frequency (e.g. once every 3 years) and were determined each year 
as the result of a Bernoulli trial (e.g. probability of success 1/3).  During years 
when recruitment occurred, the number of recruits is drawn from a basin specific 
Poisson distribution.  Assuming that spawning results in a large number of free 
embryos and that survival to age-1 is rare, then a Poisson distribution is a good
approximation for the number of recruits.

Each new recruit is tracked after being randomly assigned an age-0 location within 
basin, an age-0 length of 200mm, and von Bertalanffy growth parameters.  Age-0 bend 
locations are generated from a discrete uniform distribution that includes all 
bends within basin, while growth parameters are generated from the same 
basin specific truncated bivariate normal distribution used during the 
initialization of the population.  Initial length was chosen as 200mm, 
because (REASON HERE).  Despite fixed initial lengths, the growth 
trajectories of recruits will differ due to variation in their 
individual growth parameters.        


# Discussion
There were several assumptions made in the simulation of the reference 
populations.  While the major assumptions are reasonable for the given 
objectives, a further discussion of some assumptions 

Additionally, since it is unclear how closely assumptions 3 and 4 are 
met in reality, we explore and discuss the consequences of breaking 
these movement assumptions on estimator outputs in Appendix ??. 

<!-- NOT SURE ABOUT THESE SECTIONS...
# Results 

* Number of bends for each RPMA


# Discussion
* Virtual versus power analysis of a post-hoc glm to get trend

How did wildhaber and adam do it did they do virtual or just trend.

They did essentially the same thing, evaluating what the change in cpue
was rather than actually doing trend. In other words what is the power to 
detect a 10% decrease in the mean where mean cpue was estimated for each 
year but not as a function of year.
