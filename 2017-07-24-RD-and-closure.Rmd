### In a nutshell

Here are the highlights for those that do not want to read the post in 
its entirety. 

* This post follows up on a previous post exploring the effect of 
daily movement on estimates of abundance, but in this post, we use a 
robust design capture mark recapture approach that estimates abundance, 
survival, and movement rates 
* A small amount of day to day movement can result in biased estimates of
abundance, movement rate between primary sampling occasions (i.e., year to year), and
capture probability, albeit it is likely that day to day movement rates outside of
spring are pretty low based off input from previous work by the Nebraska Crew.
* Estimates of survival appear to be robust to day to day movement, which is a good 
thing.
* In relation to the fundamental objectives, the robust design can potentially
provide estimates of the population trend (trend is survival in the absence of recruitment) and
abundance. We explore bias as a metric to quantify these fundamental objectives.

### Engage in the process

Want to engage in the process? Please let us know what you think in the 
comments or email mike.colvin [at] msstate.edu. In this post, we use 
measures of bias as a way to quantify the performance of a monitoring design.
We are also investigating precision of estimates as well which will be addressed in 
a future post. We are also linking effort and costs to the designs.

Are there other metrics (e.g., bias, precision) you suggest we should be using to 
evaluate the performance of a monitoring design? 


### Background overview

In a previous post, we looked at the effect of violating the assumption 
of closure. Specifically, we evaluated a situation we might encounter on 
the Missouri River where Pallid Sturgeon move in and out of a bend 
on a daily basis. The analysis showed that as daily movement rates 
increased, there was a positive bias associated with abundance estimates 
using the M0 abundance estimator for capture mark recapture (cmr) approaches
[(see here)](https://mcolvin.github.io/PSPAP-Reboot/2017-06-28-M0-and-closure.html). 
In this post we will look at a similar analysis but for the Robust Design. But first a 
couple of thing before we get started.

1. For more information on in an approachable form see a book chapter by
Dr. Larkin Powell [here](http://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/95e73b_6b4fc965e7054321bbba6b058ff21540.pdf)
1. The analyses presented in the blog posts are, in some cases, simplifications
of the analyses that are being conducted. Specifically, we hold some parameters 
like survival and capture probability constant for simplicity and to illustrate
the effect of parameters on monitoring design metrics like bias. The full analysis
does allow for varying parameters and the potential to evaluate difference between
origin or behavioral response (e.g., trap shyness). 

The EA team has evaluated varying monitoring approaches identified 
during the workshop by comparing known population (i.e., virtual) to 
simulated monitoring designs including catch effort and closed 
population estimators. One alternative to a catch effort program or 
estimating abundance using a closed population estimator like the M0 
model is the robust design. The robust design is similar to the M0 
estimator because it assumes a short period of closure to estimate 
abundance but also can estimate demographic rates among primary 
occasions like survival ($\phi$) and movement $(\gamma^\prime$ and 
$\gamma^{\prime\prime})$ among primary occasions. The idea of primary 
and secondary occasions are illustrated in the figure below. 





```{r,out.width='90%',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/RD-conceptual-figure.png")
```

The time between primary occasions is commonly a year, and the 
population demographics like survival and movement can play out. The 
secondary occasions occur during a short period of time when closure can 
be assumed. Relevant assumptions for the secondary occasion within a 
primary occasion (i.e., periods of where closure is assumed) are: 



1. Stay put (Emigration = 0),
2. New fish do not enter the bend (Immigration = 0), 
3. New fish are not recruited (Recruitment = 0), and 
4. Fish do not die (Survival = 1).

We also assume:

1. Fish do not lose tags,
2. We detect tags perfectly, and
3. Capture probability is equal among fish. 



The parameters estimated by the robust design include:

* the probability of surviving between primary occasions $\phi$ , 
* the probability of being outside the study area and 
unavailable for capture during the primary occasions given the animal 
was not present during the previous primary occasions given it survives 
to the current occasion $\gamma^{\prime}$, 
* the probability of being outside the study 
area and unavailable for capture during the primary occasions given the 
animal was present during the previous primary occasions given it 
survives to the current occasion $\gamma^{\prime\prime}$, and 
* the capture probability $p$.

The movement and survival parameters are added here relative to the 
previous analysis, and the movement parameters especially need a bit of 
background information. Pallid Sturgeon are allowed to move around among 
primary occasions, and the $\gamma^{\prime}$ and the 
$\gamma^{\prime\prime}$ are illustrated in the figure below. The gist is 
that the parameters are probabilities of being in one location
or another. There are varying ways 
to specify movement, but the most common one used is random where 
$\gamma^{\prime}$ and $\gamma^{\prime\prime}$ are assumed to be equal.
Random movement is the assumption of previous applications of the robust
design to estimate Pallid Sturgeon abundance and demographic rates [@WS14; @SPP12]. 
In the figure below, the observable portion of the population would be
fish within the bend, and the unobservable portion is those fish outside 
of the bend. Keep in mind these fish in the bend are 'observable' or 
in other words, you have a chance at catching them whereas fish outside the 
bend are unobservable because you are not sampling outside the bend.


```{r,out.width='90%',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/RD-conceptual-figure2.png")
```

## Is there a problem if daily movement occurs?

If bends are used as the sampling unit, there may be an effect of day to 
day movement on abundance and demographic rate estimates. Given the 
results of daily movement on the closed population estimator, it seems 
likely that abundance will be overestimated with increased daily 
movement however it is not clear how the daily movement will influence 
survival and movement among primary occasions. To be clear, estimated 
movement rate refers to movement between primary occasions (e.g., year 
to year) and is different than daily movement rate (e.g., day to day). 
In the robust design daily movement rate is assumed to be 0 (i.e., fish 
stay put in a bend) but fish can move in and out of the bend between 
primary occasions. If biased estimates result because of daily movement, 
it may limit the ability of a monitoring design to meet the fundamental 
objectives identified in the workshop. Similar to the previous analysis 
we are going to kick the wheels, so to say, of the robust design to see 
how it performs with some level of daily movement in and out of the 
bend. The objectives of this analysis were to evaluate the effect of 
daily movement on estimates of abundance, survival, movement rate and 
capture probability. 

To evaluate the effect of daily movement we simulated a cmr dataset for 
a 10 year period (i.e., 10 primary occasions) representing a single 
bend. The true parameters used to simulate the dataset were: 

* $\phi$ = 0.8 (survival)
* $\gamma^\prime$ = 0.3 (probability of staying outside of the bend)
* $\gamma^{\prime\prime}$ = 0.3 (probability of moving out of bend) 
* $p$ = 0.3 (capture probability)

For simplicity, all parameters were assumed to be constant among years. 
The initial population (in and outside of a bend) was 500 fish with 300 
of those Pallid Sturgeon occupying the bend. Daily movement rates of 0 
to 0.5 in increments of 0.05 were used to simulate 100 replicate cmr 
datasets. We then estimate abundance, survival, movement (among primary occasions, not 
daily), and capture probability using a robust design 
estimator in Program Mark. 





### Effect of violating closure assumption

Not surprisingly, as daily movement rate increased, estimated bend-level 
abundance increased. This was a similar result to the analysis of the M0 
model. The figure below illustrates the effect of daily movement on 
bend-level abundance estimates over time. The black lines are 100 
replicates of true population dynamics and the red lines are the 
estimated population dynamics. As daily movement rate increases the gap 
between the black and red lines increases illustrating the positive 
bias. 

 
```{r,echo=FALSE}
trans_black<- rgb(0,0,0,alpha=40,maxColorValue=255)
trans_red<- rgb(255,0,0,alpha=40,maxColorValue=255)
nn<-nn[order(nn$gamma2,nn$year),]
par(mfrow=c(4,3),mar=c(1,2,1,1),oma=c(4,4,1,1))
for(g2 in unique(nn$gamma2))
    {
    xxx<-subset(nn,gamma2==g2)
    est<-reshape2::dcast(xxx,year~rep,value.var="Nhat",mean)
    true<-reshape2::dcast(xxx,year~rep,value.var="Ntrue",mean)
    matplot(est[,-1],,col=trans_red,type='l',las=1,ylim=c(0,500))
    matlines(true[,-1],,col=trans_black,type='l')
    mtext(side=3, paste("Daily movement rate = ",g2,sep=""),line=-1,cex=0.65)
    }
plot.new()
legend("center", c("True abundance", "Estimated abundance"),
    col=c("black","red"),lty=1,lwd=3)
mtext(side=1, "Year",outer=TRUE,line=2)
mtext(side=2, "Abundance",outer=TRUE,line=2)
```

In the figure above, we can calculate the bias of each yearly estimate 
for each replicate where bias is the estimated abundance minus the true 
abundance (Fortunately, this is simulated data, so we know what the true 
abundance is!). Bias is measured as numbers of fish and we can make 
statements like abundance was overestimated by 20 Pallid Sturgeon. 
However, a bias of 20 Pallid Sturgeon when the true abundance is 35 fish 
versus 4000 fish is different and therefore we used a proportional bias 
calculated as $(estimated-true)/true$. Proportional bias allows a 
comparison of estimates of varying magnitude. Proportional bias is 
illustrated in the figure below for the scenarios in the above plot.
The red line denotes no bias. 

```{r,echo=FALSE}
trans_black<- rgb(0,0,0,alpha=40,maxColorValue=255)
par(mfrow=c(4,3),mar=c(1,2,1,1),oma=c(4,4,1,1))
for(g2 in unique(nn$gamma2))
    {
    xxx<-subset(nn,gamma2==g2)
    pbias<-reshape2::dcast(xxx,year~rep,value.var="pbias",mean)
    matplot(pbias[,-1],type='l',las=1,col=trans_black,ylim=c(-0.2,2))
    abline(h=0,col="red")
    mtext(side=3, paste("Daily movement rate = ",g2,sep=""),line=-1,cex=0.65)
    }
mtext(side=1, "Year",outer=TRUE,line=2)
mtext(side=2, "Proportional bias",outer=TRUE,line=2)
```

Using the proportional bias values illustrated above we can calculate 
the average bias for each replicate, thus characterizing bias over the 
10 year monitoring period. Using the mean proportional bias values, we 
can visualize the effect of increasing daily movement rates on 
bend-level abundance estimates for a 10 year period in the boxplot below. 


```{r,echo=FALSE}
boxplot(pbias~gamma2,xx,las=1, 
    ylab="Proportional bias", xlab="Movement rate")
    abline(h=0,col="red")
    text(10.3,0,"No bias", col="red",pos=1)
```

We can also look at how estimates of survival, movement, and capture 
probability are affected by daily movement as well. Fortunately, we used 
constant values among years so no need to average among years. The 
boxplot below illustrates the effect of daily movement on estimates of 
movement rate and survival among primary occasions and capture probability. 
Even with a little bit of daily movement 
the among primary occasion movement probability has a substantial 
negative bias. 




```{r,fig.align="center",echo=FALSE}
boxplot(I((gammahat-gammaTrue)/gammaTrue)~gamma2,pp,boxwex=0.25,
    at=c(1:11)-0.3,xaxt='n',range=8,xlab="Daily movement rate",
    ylab="Proportional bias")
boxplot(I((Shat-Strue)/Strue)~gamma2,pp,add=TRUE,boxwex=0.25,col="red",range=8)
boxplot(I((phat-ptrue)/ptrue)~gamma2,pp,add=TRUE,boxwex=0.25,
at=c(1:11)+0.3,xaxt='n',col="darkgrey",range=8)
abline(h=0,col="red")
legend("top", c("Movement","Survival","Capture probability"),
    fill=c("white","red","darkgrey"),ncol=3,cex=0.8,bty='n')

```
The effect of daily movement on survival estimates was negligible as 
illustrated above, suggesting estimates of the trend may be robust to 
violating the assumption of closure among secondary occasions. Similar 
to the M0 analysis capture probability estimates show a negative bias 
with increasing daily movement rate. 


### Linking back to fundamental objectives


 The robust design has the potential to achieve a couple of fundamental 
objectives, specifically those relating to abundance and trend 
estimates. In addition estimated movement rates can inform one of the 
sub objectives identified during the workshop, movement. In the process 
of evaluating how a monitoring design can meet fundamental objectives, 
we are pushing the models to violate the assumptions and see what the 
consequences are. In this analysis violating closure can influence 
abundance estimates, but survival estimates appear to be robust. So it 
seems the robust design can do a decent job at estimating trend since 
there is no recruitment population trend is simply survival, but it may 
result in some overestimates of abundance. However given the input from 
the Nebraska crew we can potentially look at whether daily movement rates 
are large enough to result in any real issue. One caveat to consider is 
that if recruitment is occurring $\lambda$ is survival plus recruitment 
rate, so further work needs to evaluate the effect of daily movement 
when recruitment > 0. 


## Coming up

Coming up we will explore how the outcomes of alternative monitoring 
designs can be evaluated regarding the achieving the fundamental 
objectives.
