Abundance

Site-level

* How many replicates are needed to estimate abundance reliably?  What is reliable?
    * Constant p
    * Heterogeneous capture probability
    * Some movement in and out
* Benefit of using tagged critters?

Segment-level

* Estimates from 25% of bends in segment per year?
* Dependent on bend size
* Relate to density?
* Consequences of some movement?
