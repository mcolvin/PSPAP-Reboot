## About the PSPAP



The Pallid Sturgeon Population Assessment Program (PSAPS) began in 2003. 


Current population assessment overview
Background and implementation
The PSPAP program began in 2003 
Ramped up in xxx The Pallid Sturgeon


## Spatial extent, grain, organization, and sampling 

The spatial grain of the monitoring program is the river bend, defined 
as {welker and drobish}. Within each segment, 25% of bends are randomly 
sampled annually. Bends may be sampled the following year if selected 
and there are no fixed reaches that are sampled each year.

Missouri River pallid sturgeon recovery is limited to the upper and 
lower Missouri. River segments, Recovery Priority Management Areas 
(RPMA) 2 and 4 respectively (Figure 1.1). As part of the Effects 
Analysis (EA), RPMA 2 and 4 are referred to as the upper and lower 
basins respectively.

* Segment 3 (RM 1701-1582) Wolf Point to Yellowstone River Confluence
* Segment 4 (RM 1582-1568) Yellowstone to headwaters of Lake Sakakawea


RPMA 4 (lower basin; Gavins Point to Mississippi River)

* Segment 7 (RM 881-750) Gavins Point to Ponca Bend
* Segment 8 (RM 750-595.5) Lower Ponca Bend to Platte River
* Segment 9 (RM 595.5-367.5) Platte River to Kansas River
* Segment 10 (RM 367.5-250) Kansas River to Grand River
* Segment 11 (RM 0-20) Kansas River Segment
* Segment 13 (RM 250-130) Grand River to Osage River
* Segment 14 (RM 130-0) Osage River to Mississippi River

Note that segment 12 was merged into segment 13 in 2005.

Sampling is required in the segments defined above as part of the PSPAP. 
Additional segments are identified for major tributaries of the RPMA 2 
and 4 and can be sampled as needed. These segments can also specify 
reservoirs (i.e., segments 51 to 56).

The upper basin contains `r sum(xx[xx$B_SEGMENT %in% c(1:4),]$N)` bends 
and `r round(sum(xx[xx$B_SEGMENT %in% c(1:4),]$seglength),0)` km of 
river. The lower basin is longer than the upper basin covering `r 
round(sum(xx[xx$B_SEGMENT %in% c(7:11,13,14),]$seglength),0)` rkm and `r 
sum(xx[xx$B_SEGMENT %in% c(7:11,13,14),]$N)` bends. Bends in the upper 
and lower basin vary in length and average `r 
round(mean(bends[bends$B_SEGMENT %in% c(1:4),]$LENGTHRKM),1)` and `r 
round(mean(bends[bends$B_SEGMENT %in% c(7:11,13,14),]$LENGTHRKM),1)` rkm 
respectively. 


The approach evaluated here was designed to inform pallid sturgeon 
monitoring and assessment objectives and integrate with the Pallid 
Sturgeon population model. The core of sampling effort is based on a 
robust design and an integrative population model proposed to serve as 
the population inventory framework assimilating data needed to estimate 
parameters for the population model, calibrate catch data, and to 
provide a check on population estimate trends. The objectives of the 
population assessment approach described here is to develop and approach 
that: 


## Capture-recapture of marked Individuals

Historically, individual Pallid Sturgeon were marked with passive 
integrated transponder (PIT), radio or acoustic tag. PIT tags provide a 
way to uniquely identify fish when they are captured, but the amount of 
information provided by PIT tags is constrained by recapture of the 
fish. However if a PIT tagged fish is recaptured, it can inform 
estimates of survival, origin (i.e., natural, hatchery), and growth. 
Alternatively, fish that are tagged with an acoustic or radio tags can 
be actively tracked or passively detected, informing migration rates, 
habitat use, and survival. Using marked fish within a robust design will 
likely be limited to PIT tagged fish; however use of acoustic or radio 
tagged fish is discussed below. Design and Understanding from 
Simulations A preliminary simulation was performed as a proof of concept 
to evaluate whether a capture-recapture study of individual fish using a 
robust design would be feasible on a river the size of the Missouri 
River. First a geographic template was used based on the current PSPAP 
river bend sampling units, where a river bends are defined as a three 
continuous habitats (channel cross-over, inside bend, outside bend) and 
vary in number and size from for the lower and upper basin (Lower: 
N=317, mean=4 rkm, min=0.2, max=19; Upper: N=157, mean=2.3, min=0.6, 
max=8). Simulations were performed using the lower basin sampling units 
as templates. Population dynamics were simulated given known 
recruitment, survival, and abundance. Given the population dynamics, 
capture histories were simulated for two levels of capture probability 
0.1 and 0.4. These values were selected based on capture probability 
estimates (Rotella and Hadley 2010, Steffensen et al. 2015). These 
simulated capture histories were then used to estimate population 
abundance, survival, and recruitment. The robust design estimator used 
was the simplest case, assuming homogenous capture probabilities among 
secondary sampling units and that capture probability was homogenous 
among bends. The simulation used 5 primary sampling periods and varying 
secondary sampling occasions (2 through 10) to evaluate estimator 
performance, reliability, and effort levels. Within a primary sampling 
occasion at least 2 secondary capture occasions are required to estimate 
the population using capture-recapture of marked individuals and more 
are likely needed if heterogeneous capture probabilities are present. 
Over a spatial extent, sampling at least 20% of the river bends was 
necessary in preliminary simulations. While this preliminary simulation 
does not address specific gears, selecting gears and sampling occasions 
that maximize catch will likely result in reduced effort. Based on 
preliminary analyses, the population abundance could be estimated 
(Figure 2). With the exception of a capture probability of 0.1 
reasonable abundance estimates were achieve by sampling 20% of the bends 
if capture probability was 0.4 (Figure 2). If capture probability was 
0.1 either more bends needed to be sampled or 6 or greater sampling 
occasions. There was no appreciable effect of increased secondary 
occasions to estimate population abundance if capture probability was 
0.4. It should be recognized these simulations were conducted under the 
best case scenario (i.e., homogeneous survival and capture probability) 
and therefore may not reflect the challenges to sampling a large turbid 
river like the Missouri River and additional study is required to 
evaluate 'worst case' scenarios. Additional Information to Complete 
Design This simulation study is preliminary and suggests that a robust 
design mark recapture approach may be a useful monitoring approach. To 
fully complete the robust design, a level 1 study should be implemented 
to evaluate spatial and temporal configurations required to achieve 
acceptable population and demographic rate estimates. Additionally, if 
the monitoring program will be used to detect the effect of management 
actions, a power analysis must be completed. The amount of effort 
required to provide reasonable estimates should be considered. Lastly, 
including auxiliary information such as data from tagging arrays or 
river tracking in an integrated population model will provide a unifying 
framework incorporating system level monitoring and providing estimates 
and feedback necessary to parameterize and calibrate the population 
model. Caveats and considerations There are many assumptions required to 
estimate population abundance and demographic rates. For example, in 
this preliminary analysis survival and detection probability was 
constant among primary and secondary occasions, which is likely a poor 
assumption. Additionally, factors affecting Pallid Sturgeon survival, 
such as age, growth, condition were not evaluated and should be 
accounted for to improve estimates and also capture the effect of these 
variables on survival such that they can then be potentially linked to 
management actions. Additional research will be required to evaluate the 
trade-offs of efforts with estimate bias and precision. Also, evaluation 
of how sensitive estimates are to violation of assumption will be 
necessary prior to implementation of monitoring programs. Lastly, the 
monitoring design will have to be optimized within the constraints of 
the finite resources available to monitor Pallid Sturgeon on an annual 
basis, which is not a trivial task in a large turbid system like the 
Missouri River.

## About this report {#study-area}

This report steps through simulations to evaluate potential PSPAP 
designs that align with the the fundamental objectives outlined by the 
XXXXXX and described above. There are 3 major sections providing the 
results of simulations to evaluate estimating 1) abundance, 2) 
demographic rates, and 3) abundance and demographic rates. Within each 
section the results of analysis are provided with increasing complexity. 
The results of simple analyses provide the foundation for more complex 
analyses that may be robust to violation of assumptions, which is likely 
in the Missouri River. Therefore analyses can be viewed as an iterative 
process and early iterations are retained in this document for 
foundation and transparency.

Fundamental Objective: Avoid jeopardizing the continued existence of 
the pallid sturgeon from the US Army Corps of Engineers actions on the 
Missouri River. 

1. Sub-objective 1: Increase pallid sturgeon recruitment to age 1. 
    * Metrics: primary metric is catch rates of age 0 and age 1 pallid 
    sturgeon; 
    * Secondary metrics include model-based estimates of 
    abundance of age 0 and age 1 pallid sturgeon, and the survival of 
    hatchery and naturally reproducing fish to age 1. 
2. Sub-objective 2: Maintain or increase numbers of pallid sturgeon as an 
interim measure until sufficient and sustained natural recruitment 
occurs.
