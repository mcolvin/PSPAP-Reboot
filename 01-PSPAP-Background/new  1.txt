Reprise CEMs as broad framework. Count fish in boxes, evaluate rates. 
Broader set of monitoring objectives, trends, effectivness. IRC, 
augmentation, spawning habitat 4.2.6.5 (for example), Intakeâ€¦ Provide 
table from chapter. how effectiveness monitoring should integrate with 
PSPAP.

* Need to clarify and define monitoring types from the start 
(Population, effectiveness, implementation) 
* Is there other monitoring occurring that is not part of PSPAP, HAMP...
