# Monitoring, Learning, and Decision Making

## Assimilation and interpretation of data for decision making
	
Adaptive management of the Pallid Sturgeon in the Missouri River will 
require multiple sources of information, at varying spatial and 
implementation scales. Hypothesis driven monitoring and research also 
will be required to assess specific management actions. Monitoring data 
provides three inputs to the decision making process and adaptive 
management. First, monitoring data provides information which in turn 
reduces uncertainty of the current state of the system (i.e., abundance 
of Pallid Sturgeon). This is important as management decisions likely 
depend on the current state of the system. For example, the level of 
population augmentation (i.e., stocking) required to meet sub-objectives 
will likely depend on population abundance. Second, monitoring data 
provides feedback necessary to evaluate implemented system-level 
management decisions (level 3) as part of the adaptive management 
process, albeit it may take many years to realize a system level effect 
in monitoring data. In this case, the effect a management action on the 
population is predicted and monitoring data provides the necessary 
feedback to evaluate whether the predicted population response was 
realized. Management action specific monitoring also is required to 
evaluate management actions that may not be detectable at the system 
level (e.g., effect of IRC on free embryo and exogenously feeding larval 
Pallid Sturgeon survival). Lastly monitoring is necessary to determine 
whether population objectives and sub-objectives have been met. 


Challenges exist to using monitoring data that provides a relative index 
of the population for adaptive management and decision making. 
Specifically, previous PSPAP monitoring indexed population abundance by 
catch per unit effort (CPUE), which assumes that CPUE is proportional to 
abundance and catchability is constant over time and space (Harley et 
al. 2001). Catch effort data can exhibit patterns of hyper-stability 
where catch suggests population abundance is higher than it actually is 
or hyper-depletion where catch suggests population abundance is lower 
than it actually is. The use of catch per effort data also conflicts 
with population objectives of 5,000 individual Pallid Sturgeon in each 
management unit. Calibration of CPUE to Pallid Sturgeon abundance is 
necessary to determine whether this sub-objective has been met. The 
value of uncalibrated CPUE data can be of limited value in a decision 
making context if fundamental objectives focus on population abundance 
rather than relative abundance, especially if relative indexes are 
biases. The use of varying sources of information (Level 1 and 2 
science, process and implementation monitoring, and system level 
monitoring) in a decision making context presents a final challenge to 
the adaptive management process. 


The model developed to simulate population dynamics and evaluate 
management actions provides a flexible framework to evaluate the 
consequences of management actions on population dynamics and growth 
($\lambda $; defined as ${{N}_{t+1}}/{{N}_{t}}$). The effects of 
management actions are propagated to the population through effects to 
demographic rates, survival in this case. In many cases baseline 
survival is unknown with a high degree of uncertainty and the effect of 
a management action on survival is an additional unknown. These unknowns 
may be parameterized by expert elicitation, existing values, or by model 
calibration. As the adaptive management process moves forward additional 
information will become available that will refine and ideally improve 
the survival rates and associated uncertainties. These values may become 
available as a result of controlled experiments or field studies and 
this information should be assimilated and incorporated in a manner that 
results in a useable input such that the population model can be used as 
a decision support tool. 


# Assimilation and integrating monitoring, research and management
	
Integrating monitoring with the adaptive management plan will pose 
challenge in a decision making context. In particular, the adaptive 
management plan utilizes multiple sources of information at varying 
scales of implementation (Level 1 and 2, Process and implementation). 
Level 1 study consists of small scale experiments and information 
learned from these studies may not adequately scale to the population 
level. For example, scientific studies conducted in ponds, flumes, or 
under controlled laboratory conditions may not generalize to the 
population level. However this information is important to synthesize an 
incorporate into decision making and adaptive management as these values 
may be the only source of that can inform demographic rates used in the 
population model. A formal framework to integrate information acquired 
from studies at the varying levels has not been developed and represents 
a challenge to integrate information across study levels. 


The exact nature of a framework to integrate what is learned from levels 
of studies in the AM plan is uncertain. One approach that has been used 
to combine sources of information is Bayes Theorem, which can assimilate 
prior and current information into a posterior distribution of values. 
This approach is potentially useful because it can be used in either a 
scenario planning approach (i.e., evaluating scenarios through a model) 
or in a decision model such as a Bayesian Decision Network (BDN) (Nyberg 
et al. 2006). This section provides an example of how Bayes Theorem is 
used to update a distribution of survivals for embryos and some 
potentially usefly applications of BDNs to assimilate and incorporate 
information learned from studies at varying levels in a decision making 
context. It should be recognized that this is one approach that shows 
promise and is commonly used in a decision making context, but there may 
be other approaches that are more suitable, however are yet 
unidentified. 


Suppose that prior to any level of study, survival of embryos to free 
embryos (${{\phi }_{embryo}}$) was believed to be some value with some 
measure of uncertainty. This value and associated uncertainty can be 
derived by literature review or expert elicitation. In this hypothetical 
example, suppose the initial value and associated uncertainty for embryo 
survival (${{\phi }_{embryo}}$) was determined by expert elicitation. An 
approach to perform the elicitation would be to have experts adjust the 
parameters of the equation\[\text{logit}({{\phi }_{embryo}})={{\beta 
}_{0}}+\varepsilon \], where $\beta_0$ is the expected survival on logit 
scale and $\varepsilon $ is a normally distributed error term 
controlling the uncertainty around $\phi_{embryo}$. If the results of 
this hypothetical elicitation were ${{\beta }_{0}}=-12.1$ and 
$\varepsilon =0.2$, the resulting distribution of ${{\phi }_{embryo}}$ 
is illustrated in Figure 1. This distribution of ${{\phi }_{embryo}}$ 
values can then be used in stochastic population simulations to evaluate 
population dynamics and viability over the long term. 

	
Model parameterized by expert elicitation provides a rapid framework to 
evaluate the effect of management actions in an objective that otherwise 
may take months to years or may be impossible to estimate. Sensitivity 
analysis provides a method to evaluate how dependent model outcomes are 
on these inputs and potentially guide research and monitoring. As the 
adaptive management plan moves forward, studies at varying levels will 
further inform demographic parameters like ${{\phi }_{embryo}}$. For 
example, suppose a study is implemented that provides estimates of 
embryo survival based on a flume study and survival was estimated from 
the same logit linear model where ${{\beta }_{0}}=-11.5$ and 
$\varepsilon =0.1$ which is illustrated in Figure 1. This study, while 
not at the scale of the entire system, provides additional information 
on embryo survival and can be incorporated and assimilated using Bayes 
theorem to update the distribution of survival values resulting from 
expert elicitation (Hilborn and Mangel 1997, Clemen et al. 2001, Conroy 
and Peterson 2013). Incorporating and assimilation the information 
results in a posterior distribution representing the assimilation of the 
two information sources illustrated in Figure 1. Population model 
simulations can then be conducted using the new distribution of 
survivals assimilating expert elicitation and monitoring results. 


# Power of monitoring data to detect management effect

Effective monitoring is a critical component to detecting the effect of 
and providing feedback of level 3 management actions implemented on the 
system. Therefore a monitoring program has to be designed to provide 
sufficient power to detect the effect of management actions. In most 
research studies, power is typically set such that the sampling program 
detects an a priori effect size 80% of the time. In the case of Pallid 
Sturgeon, management actions are believed to effect population 
demographic rates, which are illustrated in the CEMs. Many of these 
responses are on survival which is bound by 0 and 1. Given the bounds on 
survivals, effects are likely asymmetrical which can complicate simple 
power analyses. For example, a 10% increase or decrease in an adult 
survival (${{\phi }_{adult}}$) of 0.92 is 1.012 and 0.828 respectively. 
The 10% increase results in survival exceeding 100%, highlighting the 
challenge of power analysis to reliably detect biologically meaningful 
effects due to constrained parameter space. Lastly, suitable effect size 
should be determined a priori, however the practical realities of finite 
sampling resources will likely limit the reliable detection of an 
effect, unless the effect is large (i.e., it is easier to detect large 
effects with less effort). Simulation studies will be required to 
evaluate whether detecting effects of varying magnitudes is feasible. 


# Value of monitoring data

A challenge facing monitoring programs is how much data is sufficient to 
make a decision and in the context of finite sampling resources. The 
value of information can be meaningful in decision contexts where 
multiple sources of information are assembled to reduce uncertainty 
around current system state or functional relationships (Conroy and 
Peterson 2013, Canessa et al. 2015). If a BDN is developed, the network 
contains a utility that corresponds to an objective, the value of 
various sources of information, perfect or imperfect (i.e., monitoring 
data), can be calculated (Moore and Runge 2012, Conroy and Peterson 
2013, Canessa et al. 2015). Additionally, in cases where there are 
multiple metrics that require monitoring but resources preclude 
monitoring all metrics, a value of information analysis can facilitate 
prioritization of monitoring efforts in the context of making a 
decision. For example, the number of Pallid Sturgeon 50 years in the 
future depends on the current number of Pallid Sturgeon. However, there 
is uncertainty in current Pallid Sturgeon abundance estimates that could 
be reduced by monitoring. Similarly, there also is uncertainty in 
survival rates that could be reduced by monitoring or additional 
research. How finite monitoring and research resources are allocated 
(e.g., does an agency target abundance or survival) to reduce 
uncertainty can be informed by a value of information analysis. This 
type of analysis when performed in conjunction with a sensitivity 
analysis can provide a framework to determine how valuable information 
acquired from monitoring and research is, but it requires BDN which in 
turn requires a set of decision alternatives and a utility. 


# Caveats and considerations

The approach illustrated in the two hypothetical examples is one 
approach that may be used to assimilate and incorporate information from 
varying monitoring designs and levels of study in the adaptive 
management process. This approach is easily used in a BDN framework as 
well as in scenario modeling, providing support to using the population 
model for scenario planning or decision support. As demonstrated in the 
example, attention needs to be applied to studies such that analyses can 
be assimilated. Specifically one needs to be able to combine information 
based off a distribution or predictive model. Additional consideration 
should be given to how much belief or weight is given each information 
source, if this approach is applied. For example, should data from 
mesocosm experiments receive similar or twice the weight of expert 
elicitations? What about in relation to field level studies and 
implementations? Assimilating and incorporating varying information 
sources that will arise from the AM plan will be a challenge requiring 
careful consideration as to how results will fit together with the 
population model to support for decision analysis and scenario planning.
