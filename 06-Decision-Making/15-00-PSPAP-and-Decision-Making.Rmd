## Background



### Workshop

### Refining objectives


#### Alternative monitoring designs

Adults

1. Catch per unit effort --. `Population structure and 
other characteristics`, `Quantify PS population trend`, and `Maintain compatiblity 
with legacy data`
    1. `Trammel nets` --> `Quantify catch rates of age 0 and age 1 PS` and 
    `catch rates of all PS by size class` 


2. 

Age-0

Age-1

Age-2+ 

#### Fish level monitoring

1. Fish length & weight


### Decision

* `Use smaller gill mesh` --> `Population estimates for PS for all size and 
age classes, particularly ages 2 to 3`
