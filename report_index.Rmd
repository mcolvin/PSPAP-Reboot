## What is the purpose of this document {-}

## The Missouri River Pallid Sturgeon Effects Analysis {-}

The need for a broadly defined Effects Analysis (EA) was recognized by 
the Missouri River Independent Science Advisory Panel (Doyle and others, 
2011). The Panel wrote: “The development of an adaptive management 
plan should be preceded by and based upon an effects analysis that 
incorporates new knowledge that has accrued since the 2003 Biological 
Opinion”, referring to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s (USFWS) 
amended biological opinion for operation of the Missouri River mainstem 
reservoir system and maintenance of the Missouri River Bank 
Stabilization and Navigation Project, and operation of the Kansas River 
reservoir system (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2003). The concept of 
an effects analysis is explained by Murphy and Weiland (2011) as a 
systematic evaluation of the effects that a federal agency action that 
has the potential to harm a listed species. The three essential 
components of an EA are: 


* Collection of reliable scientific information,
* Critical assessment and synthesis of available data and analyses, and 
* Analysis of the effects of actions on listed species and their habitats.

The last step needs to be as quantitative as possible in order to 
forecast expected ecological costs and benefits of an action, and to 
evaluate trade-offs with socio-economic costs and benefits. The output 
of an EA provides a useful framework for ongoing assimilation of data 
from hypothesis-driven monitoring and research, if sufficiently 
quantitative, can be used to evaluate alternative management actions in 
structured decision making (Murphy and Weiland, 2014). In the ideal 
situation, an effects analysis includes quantitative population dynamics 
or population viability models that can be used to forecast population 
effects of management actions (Murphy and Weiland, 2011, 2014) 


## Structure of the report {-}

The efforts documented in this report represent a iterative and integrative
approaches to developing a monitoring program that:

1. Meets the needs of ongoing adaptive management,
2. Is compatible with the collaborative pallid sturgeon population model
3. Is compatible with conceptual ecological models elicited during the 
effects analysis process, and 
4. Provides sufficiently reliable and precise population metrics to 
evaluate whether fundamental objectives have been achieved. 


In many sections an iterative process was used to develop analyses and 
estimators with many simplifying assumptions (e.g., homogeneous capture 
and detection probabilities) and simulations performed to evaluate the 
precision and reliability of estimates. Because the Missouri River is 
a large river, simplifying assumptions are commonly violated and 
therefore assumptions were relaxed to evaluate precision and reliability 
of estimated values. The iterative relaxing of assumptions also allowed 
us to evaluation the potential consensuses of violating simplifying 
assumptions AWKWARD. The general structure for each analysis was: 



1. Simulate data using a plausible range of values (i.e., true values)
2. Estimate values of interest and compare estimates to true values
    1. Bias
    2. Precision
    3. Reliability
3. Simulate data from process models that violate estimate assumptions 
and estimate values. For example if an analysis assumed homogeneous 
capture probability, data was simulated using a process model with 
increasing heterogeneous capture probability to evaluate the 
consequences of this assumption. 



This book is organized into 10 sections.

2. Estimating pallid sturgeon abundance
3. Estimating Pallid Sturgeon Demographic Rates
4. Estimating Pallid Sturgeon Abundance and Demographic Rates
5. Effort, cost, and logistics
6. Monitoring, Learning, and Decision Making
7. Assimilation and integrating monitoring, research and management
8. Power of monitoring data to detect management effect
9. Value of monitoring data
10. Caveats and considerations
