# Overview

The need to redesign the PSPAP was triggered by the recognition that the 
current PSPAP may not allow evaluation of whether the pallid sturgeon 
fundamental objectives identified in the AM plan were achieved on an 
annual basis or estimated with any level of certainty. Specifically, 
sub-objectives listed in section 4.1.1. of the AM plan specify 1) 
increase pallid sturgeon recruitment to age-1, and 2) maintain or 
increase numbers of pallid sturgeon as an interim measure until 
sufficient and sustained natural recruitment occurs, both of which are 
needed to achieve the fundamental objective set by the USFWS to preclude 
species jeopardy. These two sub-objectives are redefined as fundamental 
objectives in the context of the monitoring program to quantify 
recruitment to age-1 and quantify pallid sturgeon population trend and 
abundance. 

Metrics to assess achievement of the first sub-objective (increase 
pallid sturgeon recruitment to age-1) are particularly challenging 
because of the rarity of the species and existing technical difficulties 
with capturing age-1 (and age-2, age-3) fish and in accurately 
determining ages. As direct assessment of recruitment to age-1 is 
unlikely to be successful, the PSPAP v. 2.0 process has proceeded with 
the assumption that recruitment will need to be assessed through 
estimates of abundance and trend of older fish, determination of 
hatchery or wild origin, and back-calculation of age-1 recruitment rates 
through a well-calibrated and validated population model. As reported in 
Section 4.1.1 of the AM plan, metrics for assessing the second 
sub-objective (maintain or increase numbers of pallid sturgeon as an 
interim measure) include population estimates for pallid sturgeon for 
all size and age classes, where age classes are estimated by the 
population model. 

As indicated above, estimates of population abundance and trend are key 
to assessing both AMP pallid sturgeon sub-objectives. Moreover, the 
objective of the PSPAP redesign effort is to identify monitoring designs 
(sampling designs and abundance and trend estimators) that will give 
optimal estimates given budget constraints. Therefore, both the 
generation and the assessment of abundance and trend estimates play a 
key role in this analysis. Here we focus on the generation of the 
abundance and trend estimates, i.e. the metrics for assessing the AM 
sub-objectives, leaving the assessment of these estimates to the 
following section.

and performance.--> 

### Objectives

The objectives of this analysis were to:

1. Apply various abundance estimators to each of the simulated catch 
data (that were generated from several different sampling strategies) to 
produce abundance estimates at the bend level. 
2. Use various trend estimators to generate a measure of the population 
trend over a 10-year period by basin. 
3. Use length data and various abundance estimators to generate 
population estimates for each length class. 

  

### Major Assumptions
We made the typical assumptions associated with the use of each 
individual estimator. In general, these assumptions match the 
assumptions used to produce the reference populations (SECTION) and 
simulated catch data (SECTION). Any major assumptions additional to 
those previously discussed are included in the Methods Section 
discussion of the particular estimator to which it applies. 



# Methods
### Scope and Spatial Scale
Since accurately identifying fish age in the field is challenging and 
the AM plan specifies that age classes are to be estimated by the 
collaborative population model, we limit our current focus to overall 
population estimates for pallid sturgeon, as well as population 
estimates by size class. 



The methods and scale varies based on the particular abundance 
estimator, each of which is discussed Whenever possible, population 
estimates were made at the bend level and then aggregated to the segment 
level. There were a few cases, where we could not achieve this spatial 
scale of estimation and the details of how
