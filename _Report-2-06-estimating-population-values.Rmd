The need to redesign the PSPAP was triggered by the recognition that the 
current PSPAP may not allow evaluation of whether the pallid sturgeon 
fundamental objectives identified in the AM plan were achieved on an 
annual basis or estimated with any level of certainty. Specifically, 
sub-objectives listed in section 4.1.1. of the AM plan specify 1) 
increase pallid sturgeon recruitment to age-1, and 2) maintain or 
increase numbers of pallid sturgeon as an interim measure until 
sufficient and sustained natural recruitment occurs, both of which are 
needed to achieve the fundamental objective set by the USFWS to preclude 
species jeopardy. These two sub-objectives are redefined as fundamental 
objectives in the context of the monitoring program to quantify 
recruitment to age-1 and quantify pallid sturgeon population trend and 
abundance. 

Metrics to assess achievement of the first sub-objective (increase 
pallid sturgeon recruitment to age-1) are particularly challenging 
because of the rarity of the species and existing technical difficulties 
with capturing age-1 (and age-2, age-3) fish and in accurately 
determining ages. As direct assessment of recruitment to age-1 is 
unlikely to be successful, the PSPAP v. 2.0 process has proceeded with 
the assumption that recruitment will need to be assessed through 
estimates of abundance and trend of older fish, determination of 
hatchery or wild origin, and back-calculation of age-1 recruitment rates 
through a well-calibrated and validated population model. As reported in 
Section 4.1.1 of the AM plan, metrics for assessing the second 
sub-objective (maintain or increase numbers of pallid sturgeon as an 
interim measure) include population estimates for pallid sturgeon for 
all size and age classes, where age classes are estimated by the 
population model. 

As indicated above, estimates of population abundance and trend are key 
to assessing both AM plan pallid sturgeon sub-objectives. Moreover, the 
objective of the PSPAP redesign effort is to identify monitoring designs 
(sampling designs and abundance and trend estimators) that will give 
optimal estimates given budget constraints. Therefore, both the 
generation and the assessment of abundance and trend estimates play a 
key role in this analysis. Here we focus on the generation of the 
abundance and trend estimates, i.e. the metrics for assessing the AM 
sub-objectives, leaving the assessment of these estimates to the 
following section. 

Generating abundance and trend estimates under a particular monitoring 
design occurs in two steps:

1. Simulate catch data using the sampling design prescribed by the 
given monitoring program, and
2. Calculate estimates from the catch data using the abundance and trend
estimators prescribed by the given monitoring program.

Since the simulation of catch data is stochastic and certain values 
(e.g., catchability) are uncertain, these steps were repeated several 
times for each monitoring design, generating a fuller picture of the 
range of outcomes that can be expected under a particular monitoring 
design.

### Monitoring designs under consideration
Monitoring designs consisted of a suite of sampling and estimator 
decisions (Figure ??).  While we consider variations on current sampling
decisions, compatibility with existing PSPAP data can be achieved by 
maintaining the existing sampling framework where each management unit 
is divided into segments, river segments divided into bends, and habitat 
units sampled with each bend. Additionally, continued use of current 
PSPAP standard gear types defined in Welker et al. (2017), which have 
been identified over the duration of the PSPAP to be effective, will 
potentially maintain compatibility with existing PSPAP data. A 
significant modification, however, will be required to estimate 
population abundance. Specifically, the use of a capture-recapture 
estimator to estimate demographic rates and abundance is considered.

#### Sampling Decisions


#### Estimator Decisions




Several capture-recapture estimators exist to estimate abundance, 
demographic rates, as well as abundance and demographic rates. A capture 
recapture estimator that simultaneously estimates demographic rates and 
abundance can potentially achieve metrics and targets specified in 
sub-objectives 1 and 2. Historically, a Jolly-Seber model, was used to 
simultaneously estimate abundance and survival from recapture of marked 
individuals from singular capture occasions over time (Jolly 1963, 1965, 
Seber 1965). However, the lack of multiple within occasion recapture 
attempts required potentially unrealistic assumptions to estimate 
capture probability. Some of these assumptions can be relaxed by 
sophisticated model formulations or fitting the capture-recapture model 
as a Bayesian state space model, which has been done for pallid sturgeon 
in the RPMA 4 by Wu and Holan (2016). Alternatively, using multiple 
recapture efforts within a sampling year (primary occasions) allows 
direct estimation of capture probability as well as abundance and 
survival, which was described by Pollock (1982) and referred to as the 
robust design. 




The robust design frame work has been applied across a wide range of 
taxa to estimate demographic rates and population abundance. Its use has 
been extended to studies of species occurrence (i.e., occupancy models; 
MacKenzie et al. 2002, Tyre et al. 2003) and abundance (N-mixture 
models; Royle 2004b, Royle 2004a) of unmarked individuals. The robust 
design provides a rigorous framework that allows for the estimation of 
relevant demographic rates and abundance using marked individuals. As 
originally described by Pollock (1982), a robust design consists of 
primary sampling occasions with secondary sampling occasions nested with 
the primary sampling occasion (Figure 1). Primary occasions are spaced 
temporally to capture processes like survival and growth. Secondary 
occasions occur over a short time frame, short enough that closure of 
the population from demographic processes (i.e., recruitment, mortality, 
immigration, emigration) can be assumed. The secondary sampling 
occasions provide multiple opportunities for individuals to be captured 
and thereby allowing capture probability and abundance to be estimated. 


The use of a robust design capture recapture approach to estimate 
Missouri River pallid sturgeon abundance, and demographic rates are not 
novel. The first application was Steffensen et al. (2012) as part of the 
annual brood stock collection in segment 9. Similarly, Winders and 
Steffensen (2014) used a robust design to estimate abundance and 
demographic rates for a portion of segment 10 using broodstock 
collection data. In both studies, pallid sturgeon were captured by 
setting multiple trotlines at random locations in the study area over a 
short period. The annual brood stock sampling was the primary occasion 
and daily capture efforts were the secondary occasions in both studies. 
Given the study design, survival was estimated over the open period 
(i.e., between annual broodstock collection events). Capture probability 
was estimated for each daily effort within the primary period and 
abundance during the closed period (i.e., broodstock collection). 
Additionally, both studies were able to estimate movement parameters 
that account for pallid sturgeon leaving or arriving in the study area 
between closed periods. 


Specific parameters estimated by the robust design
There are variations of the robust design that estimate varying 
parameters. The most commonly used version, as well as the version used 
by Steffensen et al. (2012) and Winders and Steffensen (2014) is the 
version that estimates 6 parameters. Specifically these parameters are: 

* $\varphi $: the probability of surviving between primary occasions, 
* $\gamma^{\prime}$:  the probability of being outside the study area and unavailable for capture during the primary occasions given the animal was not present during the previous primary occasions given it survives to the current occasion (Figure 2),
* $\gamma^{\prime\prime}$:  is the probability of being outside the study area and unavailable for capture during the primary occasions given the animal was present during the previous primary occasions given it survives to the current occasion (Figure 2),
* $c$ is the initial capture probability
* $p$ is the recapture probability, and 
* $f_0$ is number of unobserved individuals.  

Depending on the situation the number of parameters estimated can be 
reduced by assuming initial capture probability is equal to recapture 
probability where $c=p$. Similarly, ${{\gamma }^{\prime }}$ and 
$\gamma^{\prime\prime}$ can be specified to represent hypotheses about 
immigration and emigration processes. For example, even flow of fish in 
and out of the systems can be specified by imposing equality of 
immigration and emigration terms where ${{\gamma }^{\prime }}={{\gamma 
}^{\prime \prime }}$. Population abundance ($N$) at each time period is 
a derived parameter calculated as: $N={{f}_{0}}+M$ where, $M$ is the 
number of marked fish. Uncerainty around parameter estimates derived 
quantities can be estimated by profile likelihood and use of the delta 
method if estimated by maximizing the likelihood of the model given the 
data (Hilborn and Mangel 1997, Powell 2012). Uncertainty can also be 
quantified simultaneously for estimated and derived parameters if fit by 
MCMC using a Bayesian approach. 

...For each of the simulated reference populations, various sampling 
decisions can be implemented to obtain simulated catch data. The choice 
of monitoring design determines the particular combination of decisions 
used in this process---system-level sampling design, within bend and 
year sampling design, gear selection, and measurements taken on 
individual fish are all prescribed by the monitoring design (Figure 1). 
Alternative sampling decisions of interest were identified during the 
PSPAP workshop at the 2017 MRNRC meeting, as well as during follow-up 
input from stakeholders and experts in the system. Simulated catch data 
have been generated from the range of the identified alternative 
sampling decisions, with the exception that some individual measurements 
have yet to be implemented and the spatially balanced system-level 
sampling design is still a work in progress.

```

### Generating abundance and trend estimates
#### Objectives

The objectives of estimating population metrics are, for each monitoring 
design considered and for each of the catch data sets generated under the 
given monitoring design, to:

1. Generate an estimate of the average population trend over the 10-year 
period by basin, 
2. Generate segment-level abundance estimates,
3. Generate segment-level abundance estimates for each length class. 

  

#### Major Assumptions
We made the typical assumptions associated with the use of each 
individual estimator. In general, these assumptions match the 
assumptions used to produce the reference populations (SECTION) and 
simulated catch data (SECTION). Any major assumptions additional to 
those previously discussed are included in the discussion of the 
particular estimator to which it applies. 



<!--# Methods-->
#### Scope and Spatial Scale
Since accurately identifying fish age in the field is challenging and 
the AM plan specifies that age classes are to be estimated by the 
collaborative population model, we limit our current focus to overall 
population estimates for pallid sturgeon, as well as population 
estimates by size class. 

Whenever possible, population abundance estimates were made at the bend 
level and then aggregated to the segment level; however, monitoring 
designs that employed the robust design abundance estimator had 
difficulty producing estimates at the bend spatial scale.  Therefore, 
all monitory designs using the robust design estimator directly 
estimated segment-level abundances.


Applications of Capture-Recapture Robust Design to PSPAP

The fundamental species objective identified by the USFWS for the pallid 
sturgeon is: Avoid jeopardizing the continued existence of the pallid 
sturgeon from the US Army Corps of Engineers actions on the Missouri 
River. Means to achieve this fundamental objective included increasing 
pallid sturgeon recruitment and maintaining or increasing current 
population levels. 

The means to achieve the fundamental objective are specified as 2 
sub-objectives with quantifiable metrics and targets as: 

1. Increase pallid sturgeon recruitment to age 1
Metric:  Catch rates of age 2 and 3 year-old pallid sturgeon.  
Target: Short-term: recruitment; long-term: projection from population 
models of an annual egg to age-1 survival rate > 0.03. 

2. Maintain or increase numbers of pallid sturgeon until sufficient and 
sustained natural recruitment occur. 

Metric:  Catch rate of all size classes 
Target: Viable population size necessary to successfully overcome 
recruitment bottleneck. Minimum of 5000 adults in each management unit. 


While a catch per unit effort based approach to population monitoring 
may be used to calculate the metrics for sub-objective 1 and 2 it fails 
to estimate sub-objective targets. Specifically, CPUE is a relative 
index of population abundance and therefore it may document recruitment 
if age-0 and age-1 pallid sturgeon are captured but it does not estimate 
early life history survival rates. Absolute population estimates cannot 
be achieved unless gear-specified catchability coefficient exists or can 
be estimated to link catch and effort to predict abundance 
as:$Abundance=Catch\cdot Effort\cdot Catchability$. Catchability 
coefficients are difficult to estimate, unlikely to be constant (i.e., 
gear-specific catchability varies among habitat type, season, fish 
species), and assumed to be constant across abundance levels. 
Catchability assumptions have received some scrutiny through 
meta-analysis of multiple fish stocks which suggest that fish stocks 
exhibit a curvilinear relationship of catchability with abundance, most 
commonly exhibiting a phenomenon known as hyperstability, where CPUE 
remains while abundance declines (Harley et al. 2001). It should be 
noted that gear-specific catchabilities have not been estimated for 
pallid sturgeon. The consequences of violating CPUE assumptions are 
uncertain. Despite this uncertainty, the CPUE based PSPAP has been 
successful in achieving PSPAP objectives, however, modifications will be 
needed to achieve sub-objective 1 and 2. 


Modifying the existing PSPAP program will ideally maintain a degree of 
compatibility with existing data while providing population level 
estimates of recruitment, trend, and abundance to achieve the metrics 
and targets specified in sub-objectives 1 and 2. Compatibility with 
existing PSPAP data can be achieved by maintaining the existing sampling 
framework where each management unit is divided into segments, river 
segments divided into bends, and habitat units sampled with each bend. 
Additionally, continued use of current PSPAP standard gear types defined 
in Welker et al. (2016), which have been identified over the duration of 
the PSPAP to be effective, will potentially maintain compatibility with 
existing PSPAP data. A significant modification will be required to 
estimate population abundance, specifically the use of a 
capture-recapture estimator to estimate demographic rates and abundance. 

Several capture-recapture estimators exist to estimate abundance, 
demographic rates, as well as abundance and demographic rates. A capture 
recapture estimator that simultaneously estimates demographic rates and 
abundance can potentially achieve metrics and targets specified in 
sub-objectives 1 and 2. Historically, a Jolly-Seber model, was used to

and thereby allowing capture probability and abundance to be estimated. 

Application of robust design to Pallid Sturgeon
The use of a robust design capture recapture approach to estimate 
Missouri River pallid sturgeon abundance, and demographic rates are not 
novel. The first application was Steffensen et al. (2012) as part of the 
annual brood stock collection in segment 9. Similarly, Winders and 
Steffensen (2014) used a robust design to estimate abundance and

was estimated for each daily effort within the primary period and 
abundance during the closed period (i.e., broodstock collection).

* $c$ is the initial capture probability
* $p$ is the recapture probability, and 
* $f_0$ is number of unobserved individuals.  

Depending on the situation the number of parameters estimated can be 
reduced by assuming initial capture probability is equal to recapture 
probability where $c=p$. Similarly, ${{\gamma }^{\prime }}$ and 
$\gamma^{\prime\prime}$ can be specified to represent hypotheses about 
immigration and emigration processes. For example, even flow of fish in

data (Hilborn and Mangel 1997, Powell 2012). Uncertainty can also be 
quantified simultaneously for estimated and derived parameters if fit by 
MCMC using a Bayesian approach. 



Achieving sub-objective metrics and targets

Recruitment

When capture recapture histories are viewed in reverse order 
recruitment can be estimated using what is referred to as a Pradel model 
(Pradel 1996). This model relies on being able to differentiate recruits 
based off of size or age which works well for fish populations. 
Therefore there are 2 processes in which a pallid sturgeon can be 
initially captured: 1) it is a new recruit and was not vulnerable to 
capture and 2) the pallid sturgeon was vulnerable to capture but not 
captured. The differentiating the 2 outcomes can be informed by size to 
improve recruitment estimates. 

Trend

While not commonly employed in fisheries literature the robust design 
can estimate population growth rate ($\lambda$). In particular, by 
running capture histories backwards estimates the probability a pallid 
sturgeon was present in the previous year given it was present in the 
current year which is the per capita rate of additions to the population 
($f$), or the number of individuals entering the population between 
primary occasions. Survival rate ($\varphi $) can be estimated, and by 
running them forward, survival can be estimated. Trend evaluated as 
population growth rate is derived from model estimates as$\lambda 
=\varphi \text{+}f$ and uncertainty can be estimated using the 
previously described approaches for$N$. 

Abundance

Absolute abundance estimates are important to ongoing adaptive 
management and recovery because species recovery sub-objective 2 is 
specified as abundance. The robust design for capture recapture provides 
the necessary within primary occasion replication to reliably estimate 
capture probabilities ($c,p$) and then estimate $N$ given the number of 
fish captured and the capture probability. Given that the capture 
recapture design is potentially using 2 or more temporal replicates 
within each bend then unadjusted catch numbers may be comparable to 
existing PSPAP CPUE data. 


Quantifying effects of management actions and auxiliary information

Parameters in capture recapture models can be related to covariates 
which provide a potential means to quantify the population response to 
management actions. For example, changes in flow can be related to 
survival or migration parameters using a logit linear model 
as$\operatorname{logit}(\theta )={{\beta }_{0}}+{{\beta }_{1}}\cdot 
X+\epsilon $, where $\theta$ is an estimated parameter (e.g., $\phi$, 
$\gamma \prime$, $\gamma\prime\prime$), $\beta_0$ is the intercept, 
${{\beta }_{1}}$ is the effect of covariate $X$, and $\epsilon $ is 
residual error. Additionally, auxiliary information can be used to 
inform parameter estimates. For example, telemetry can be used to 
determine whether a pallid sturgeon is in the study area or not and 
thereby inform estimates of $\gamma \prime$and $\gamma\prime\prime$. 
Overall ability of a capture recapture robust design to use auxiliary 
information and potential capture population level responses to 
management actions make this a potentially useful design beyond 
providing a means to quantify the metrics and targets for sub-objectives 
1 and 2. 


Caveats and considerations
Monitoring pallid sturgeon in a system as large as the Missouri River is 
inherently challenging and it is likely that any approached used will 
violate an assumption required to estimate demographic rates or 
population abundance. The previous section provides an overview of the 
robust design as a monitoring design for pallid sturgeon populations of 
the Upper and Lower Missouri River. The accurate estimation of 
population parameters represents a critical component of assessing the 
system state for pallid sturgeon in the Missouri River and providing key 
demographic values for evaluating management actions through predictive 
population modeling. The estimation of these metrics depends on the 
quality and quantity of data collected from a well-developed sampling 
design. The optimal design must be cost-efficient, and provide reliable, 
accurate data. 

Implementing an untested design on a large system like the Missouri 
River could prove costly from the expenditure of time and effort if the 
selected design performs poorly. Pallid sturgeon populations in the 
Upper and Lower Missouri Rivers differ (e.g., size and age at maturity, 
growth rates, life span). The habitats in which they live are also 
different. The Lower River is characterized by a narrow, self-scouring 
channel with higher water velocities, especially in the main channel. In 
contrast, the Yellowstone and Upper Missouri Rivers are characterized by 
lower velocities, shallower depths, and a more natural channel form. 
Differences between the two Missouri River portions has shown that the 
most effective sampling methodologies and potential strategies also 
differ significantly and therefore necessitate that the mark-recapture 
sample designs be tailored to each population. Provisional capture 
recapture population monitoring designs need to be evaluated by 
simulation modeling to identify the optimal design (that is, tradeoffs 
between precision, bias, and cost) and provide proof of concept before 
testing or implementing in the field as part of a level 1 science effort 
and adjusted periodically to improve the design so that it more 
effectively meets the monitoring and species objectives.
