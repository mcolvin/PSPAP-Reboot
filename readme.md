# Organization and workflow

Index.Rmd runs the show. It sources child documents that correspond to 
major sections. The the other Rmd files in this folder source child 
documents that link to outputs from the anlayses folder. 


I terms of work flow, compile index.Rmd to get the whole document. 
Compile each section to get a section view.
