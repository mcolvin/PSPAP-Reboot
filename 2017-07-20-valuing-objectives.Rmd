### Valuing fundamental objectives



Recall that the fundamental objectives of the PSPAP were to:

1. 
2. 
3.
4.
5.
6.

Through the workshop we identified many pathways to achieve these 
fundamental objectives. For example, using the same CPUE based 
monitoring design can achieve fundamental objective XX but it does a 
poor job achieving some of the remaining objectives. Specifically, 
abundance estimates from catch effort data are likely negatively biased, 
providing little utility in meeting fundamental objective XX. 



Bias is one way we can put a value on a monitoring design that links to a fundamental
objective. In this case, the fundamental objective provided during the workshop
was XXXXXXXXXXXXXX. In order to evaluate how alternative monitoring designs achieve the
fundamental objectives we need to develop a way to quantify this fundamental objective.
In terms of estimating abundance there are 2 measures of an estimator that are useful,
bias and precision. In the figure above, we can calculate the bias of each yearly estimate
for each rep where bias is the estimated abundance minus the true abundance. Fortunately
this is simulated data so we know what the true abundance is! Bias can then be viewed
as bias with fish as the units, for example the estimate overestimated true abundance by 200
Pallid Sturgeon or bias can be scaled proportionally. Proportional bias allows and apples
to apples comparison of the abundance estimates as a percentage. For example, a bias of
50 pallid sturgeon if the true abundance was 80 is different than if the true abundance
was 5000. 

Proportional bias is illustrated in the figure below where proportional bias was
calculated for the plot above.
